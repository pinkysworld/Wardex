# Changelog

All notable changes to SentinelEdge are documented in this file.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Phase 14 — Full admin console integration** (T137–T141): Every feature module is now wired to the admin console with API endpoints and interactive UI panels.
- **18 new API endpoints** (T137): `/api/side-channel/status`, `/api/quantum/key-status`, `/api/quantum/rotate`, `/api/privacy/budget`, `/api/policy-vm/execute`, `/api/fingerprint/status`, `/api/harness/run`, `/api/monitor/status`, `/api/monitor/violations`, `/api/deception/status`, `/api/deception/deploy`, `/api/policy/compose`, `/api/drift/status`, `/api/drift/reset`, `/api/causal/graph`, `/api/patches`, `/api/offload/decide`, `/api/swarm/posture`, `/api/energy/harvest`.
- **Security Operations panel** (T138): enforcement status/quarantine, threat intel IOC management, side-channel risk display, deception engine deploy.
- **Fleet, Digital Twin & Testing panels** (T139): fleet device registration, swarm posture, digital twin simulation, adversarial harness execution.
- **Monitoring & Analysis panel** (T140): temporal monitor status/violations, correlation analysis, drift detection reset, fingerprint status, causal graph.
- **Compliance, Quantum, Policy, Infrastructure, Formal Exports panels** (T141): compliance scoring, attestation status, privacy budget, quantum key rotation, policy composition, WASM VM execution, energy harvest/consume, patch management, workload offload, TLA+/Alloy/witness export.
- `Monitor` `Predicate` trait now requires `Send` for thread-safe admin console state.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 0.12.0 (was 0.10.0 in Cargo.toml, 0.11.0 in changelog).
- Admin console expanded from 6 panels to 14 panels with full feature coverage.
- `AppState` expanded with 10 new module instances for complete feature wiring.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Runtime pipeline wiring** (T132): All Phase 12 modules (threat intel, enforcement, digital twin, energy, side-channel, compliance) are now integrated into the `execute()` pipeline. Enrichment data (enforcement actions, TI matches, energy state, side-channel risk, compliance score) flows through the full pipeline and appears in console reports.
- **Criterion micro-benchmarks** (T133): `benches/pipeline.rs` with four benchmark groups — full pipeline scaling (5/50/200/1000 samples), detector evaluate, policy evaluate, and throughput measurement (~55K samples/sec). Unblocks Paper 1 evaluation methodology.
- **Continual learning loop** (T134): `DriftDetector` (Page-Hinkley algorithm) and `ContinualLearner` wrapper that monitors anomaly score distribution and automatically resets/re-learns the baseline when concept drift is detected. Advances R01 from foundation to research-grade.
- **Policy composition algebra** (T135): `CompositePolicy`, `compose_decisions()`, and `PolicyConflict` types supporting four composition operators (`MaxSeverity`, `MinSeverity`, `LeftPriority`, `RightPriority`) with conflict detection. Advances R39 and enables Paper 2 evaluation.
- 9 new unit tests (276 total: 255 unit + 21 integration).
- `RunResult` now includes `enforcement_actions`, `threat_intel_matches`, `energy_state`, `side_channel`, and `compliance_score` fields.
- Console report output includes enforcement, threat intel, energy, side-channel, and compliance summaries.

### Changed
- `ureq` dev-dependency now uses `default-features = false` to avoid `ring` build issues on some platforms.
- Pipeline throughput improved through integrated module wiring.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Extended test fixtures** (T110): four 120-sample CSV datasets (benign, credential storm, slow escalation, low-battery attack) for paper evaluation.
- **Fixed-threshold baseline detector** (T111): static per-signal threshold detector in `fixed_threshold.rs` with `run_fixed_benchmark` for comparison against adaptive EWMA.
- **`bench` CLI command** (T112): head-to-head detector comparison printing precision/recall/F1/accuracy and throughput.
- **Per-signal contribution aggregation** (T113): `BenchmarkResult` now carries averaged per-signal attribution; printed by `bench` CLI.
- 11 new unit tests (147 total: 126 unit + 21 integration).
- New source module: `fixed_threshold.rs`.

### Changed
- CLI commands increased to 12 (added `bench`).
- `BenchmarkHarness` now tracks and averages per-signal contributions.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Adapter-backed checkpoint restore** (T100): rollback now reapplies abstract device isolation/quarantine state via pluggable action adapters.
- **TLA+ and Alloy model export** (T101): `PolicyStateMachine::export_tla()` and `export_alloy()` produce formal verification modules; `/api/export/tla` and `/api/export/alloy` endpoints.
- **Proof backend interface** (T102): `DigestBackend` and `ZkStubBackend` with serializable witness export; `/api/export/witnesses` endpoint.
- **Single-source research-track data** (T103): canonical `research_tracks.json` consumed by runtime, API (`/api/research-tracks`), and admin console with static-file fallback.
- **Supply-chain attestation foundations** (T104): `BuildManifest` generation with SHA-256 artifact hashing, `TrustStore` management, manifest/artifact verification, `/api/attestation/status` endpoint.
- `export-model` and `attest` CLI commands.
- 31 new unit tests (115 unit + 21 integration).
- New source modules: `attestation.rs`, `proof.rs`.

### Changed
- CLI commands increased to 11 (added `export-model`, `attest`).
- Admin console `trackGroups` replaced with async `loadTrackGroups()` fetching from API/static JSON.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Correlation engine integration** (T090): runtime `execute()` now runs Pearson correlation analysis on the replay buffer and includes results in audit logs and console output.
- **Temporal-logic monitor integration** (T091): runtime pipeline feeds sample, alert, action, and transition events to a default safety monitor; violations are reported in audit and console output.
- **Correlation API endpoint** (T092): `GET /api/correlation` returns live correlation analysis of samples seen by the server-side replay buffer.
- **Harness CLI command** (T093): `cargo run -- harness` runs the adversarial test harness and prints evasion rates and coverage metrics.
- **Behavioural device fingerprinting** (T094): new `fingerprint.rs` module with `DeviceFingerprint` training from telemetry windows and Mahalanobis-inspired impersonation detection (R38).
- Server-side replay buffer in `AppState` — analyzed and demo samples are pushed to a 200-sample ring buffer for live correlation.
- 8 new unit tests across `runtime`, `fingerprint` modules (105 total: 91 unit + 14 integration).
- New source module: `fingerprint.rs`.

### Changed
- `CorrelationResult` and `CorrelatedPair` fields changed from `&'static str` to `String` for serde compatibility.
- CLI commands increased to 9 (added `harness`).
- R38 research track status updated from "future" to "foundation".

### Fixed
- JSONL line numbers in `/api/analyze` now enumerate before filter so errors report original file positions (CQ-12).
- `observed_samples` in detector uses `saturating_add` to prevent overflow (CQ-13).
- State machine `step()` validates transitions via `is_legal()` before accepting (CQ-14).
- Fingerprint standard deviation uses Bessel's correction (n−1) to avoid inflated z-scores with small sample counts (CQ-16).
- `DeviceFingerprint::train()` returns `None` if NaN/Inf propagates through computation (CQ-17).
- Temporal-logic monitor now receives state machine transition events so `no_skip_escalation` property is exercised (CQ-20).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Explainable anomaly attribution** (T080): per-signal contribution breakdown in `AnomalySignal` — each signal dimension's weighted score contribution is captured and included in JSON reports.
- **Config validation** (T081): `Config::validate()` checks threshold ordering (critical > severe > elevated), smoothing in [0.0, 1.0], non-zero warmup, and checkpoint interval. Called automatically on config load.
- **Anomaly correlation engine** (T082): Pearson-based multi-signal co-movement detection across replay buffer windows with co-rising signal identification.
- **Temporal-logic runtime monitor** (T083): lightweight SentinelTL property checker supporting safety (`always P`) and bounded-liveness (`within N samples P`) properties over live event streams.
- **Adversarial test harness** (T084): grammar-based evasion fuzzer with SlowDrip, BurstMask, and DriftInject strategies, decision-surface coverage metrics, and evasion rate measurement.
- 27 new unit tests across `detector`, `config`, `correlation`, `monitor`, and `harness` modules (96 total: 82 unit + 14 integration).
- Three new source modules: `correlation.rs`, `monitor.rs`, `harness.rs`.
