# Changelog

All notable changes to Wardex are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Operational readiness drill timeline** — Help & Docs `Production Readiness` now renders documented recovery targets (RTO/RPO), backup and checkpoint evidence, persisted failover-drill history, pass/fail artifact checks, and exportable timeline evidence for recovery reviews.
- **SOC detection review reasoning** — SOC Workbench detection-review rows now carry replay deltas plus the latest analyst verdict, note, and review timestamp so shift leads can understand review pressure before pivoting into Threat Detection.

### Changed
- **Shared review-history contract** — Rule-level replay/analyst review history now feeds both Threat Detection and SOC Workbench from the same backend derivation path, reducing cross-surface drift.
- **OIDC callback hardening** — the federated sign-in flow now requires a validated `id_token`, enforces PKCE with `S256`, verifies JWT signatures against provider JWKS, checks issuer/audience/expiry/nbf claims, and rejects nonce or subject mismatches before creating a console session.

### Backend
- **SOC workbench strengthening slices** — `GET /api/workbench/overview` now includes team load and ownership plus connector coverage impact signals, and `GET /api/cases/{id}/handoff-packet` returns structured case handoff packets for analyst turnover.
- **Command Center review summary** — `GET /api/command/summary` now carries a compact detection review calendar inside the `rule_tuning` lane, surfacing overdue reviews, due-this-week items, replay blockers, noisy owners, and direct pivots into detection promotion views.

### Frontend
- **Threat Detection ownership review calendar** — the detection workspace now shows overdue reviews, due-this-week rules, replay blockers, noisy owners, rule-level next-review timing, and promotion blockers derived from lifecycle and replay state.
- **Command Center detection review pressure** — the Detection Quality Dashboard now exposes compact review-calendar signals directly in `/command`, giving shift leads a fast path into the exact noisy or overdue rule.
- **SOC Workbench operations expansion** — the workbench now includes case handoff packets, team load and ownership, and connector coverage impact surfaces for analyst handoff and queue balancing.

### Quality and verification
- **0.56.0 quality cleanup** — frontend race/test failures were fixed, Rust doctest SIGKILL noise was removed by disabling no-op doctests for the monolithic lib target, persisted auth sessions now enforce owner-only permissions on Unix, and RBAC token persistence/listing now uses hashed/redacted token values.
- **CI stability** — command, SOC, detection, lint, build, and integration checks were refreshed so the current 0.56.0 strengthening slices land green across the local acceptance gates.

## [0.56.0] — Control-Plane Posture Evidence & Recovery Readiness

### Backend
- **Derived control-plane posture contracts** — `GET /api/support/readiness-evidence`, `GET /api/system/health/dependencies`, and `GET /api/backup/status` now expose backup schedule, observed backups, latest backup timestamp, checkpoint counts, latest checkpoint timestamp, restore readiness, and active/passive reference status from live runtime state rather than a hard-coded HA summary.

### Frontend
- **Production readiness posture summary** — Help & Docs now renders a structured control-plane posture section that shows durable storage, restore artifacts, and failover model checks alongside the existing readiness blockers.

### Documentation and release metadata
- **Control-plane tranche formalized** — backlog, roadmap, status, deployment/disaster-recovery docs, OpenAPI, Helm, OTLP, SDK metadata, README, and website status/changelog surfaces are aligned on the first control-plane posture slice and the `0.56.0` release baseline.

### Verification
- `cd admin-console && npm exec vitest run src/__tests__/HelpDocs.test.jsx`
- `cargo test --test api_integration enterprise_governance_and_support_endpoints_enforce_roles -- --exact`
- `cd sdk/typescript && npm exec vitest run src/index.test.ts -t 'readinessEvidence|systemDeps|backupStatus'`

## [0.55.1] — Release Guardrails, A11y Strictness & Node Baseline

### Release engineering
- **Checksummed release assets** — The GitHub release workflow now creates and verifies a `SHA256SUMS` asset for every published binary/package artifact.
- **Debian package smoke** — Release publishing now depends on a Linux package install smoke that installs the generated `.deb`, verifies `wardex` is on `PATH`, and checks the help command produces output.
- **Release notes by tag** — Release-body extraction now selects the changelog section matching the pushed tag, so the published notes are not taken from an empty `Unreleased` block.

### Tooling and documentation
- **Node baseline aligned** — `.nvmrc`, admin-console metadata, TypeScript SDK metadata, contributor docs, and site-quality CI now converge on Node 22 / Node `>=20.19.0` to match current Vite/jsdom/undici requirements.
- **Admin dependency audit clean** — The admin-console lockfile now resolves PostCSS to a patched release for the moderate CSS stringify advisory.
- **Release metadata refresh** — Rust, admin-console, Python SDK, TypeScript SDK, Helm, OTLP, OpenAPI, runbooks, reproducibility docs, website status data, and browser fixtures now point to `0.55.1`.

### Backend
- **Request-ID hardening** — Structured request ID generation now returns a typed clock error, includes timestamp/randomness tests, and the HTTP response boundary falls back safely if the system clock is invalid.
- **Request-ID consolidation** — API responses now use the shared structured logging request ID helper instead of carrying a second formatting path.

### Frontend
- **Strict a11y smoke expansion** — Playwright axe checks now treat the welcome and onboarding screens as strict by default, add Settings workspace coverage, and keep additional strict labels configurable via `WARDEX_A11Y_STRICT`.
- **Console warning cleanup** — Fleet recovery watchlists now de-duplicate stale/offline agents, and workspace tab accessibility tests use async render/wait flows that avoid React `act(...)` noise.
- **Settings split** — The Settings configuration tab is extracted into a focused component while preserving JSON, form, diff, reload, and reset-to-default workflows.

### Verification
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo test --all`
- `npm test --prefix admin-console -- --run --coverage`
- `npm run build --prefix admin-console`
- `npm audit --prefix admin-console --audit-level=moderate`
- `npx playwright test e2e/a11y.spec.js --project=chromium`
- `scripts/validate_release_docs.py`
- `scripts/check_contract_parity.py`
- `bash scripts/validate_container_build_contract.sh`

## [0.55.0] — Per-Lane Command APIs, Drawer Deep-Links & CI Hygiene

### Backend
- **Per-lane Command Center endpoint** — New `GET /api/command/lanes/{lane}` returns a focused slice of the existing summary so drawers and dashboards can refresh a single lane without re-fetching the entire aggregate. Supported lanes: `incidents`, `remediation`, `connectors`, `rule_tuning`, `release`, `evidence`. Returns `404` for unknown lanes.
- **OpenAPI + endpoint catalog** — The new lane route is published in both the runtime endpoint catalog (`/api/endpoints`) and the static `docs/openapi.yaml` and Rust `openapi.rs` builders.

### Frontend
- **Drawer deep-links** — Command Center drawers now sync to the URL via `?drawer=<lane>` so SOC analysts can share or bookmark a specific drawer state. The drawer state survives reloads and back/forward navigation. Item-specific context (e.g. a connector or rule selected from a row) is preserved through the local component while the lane lives in the URL.
- **Wider analyst entrypoints** — Same `/command` default destination, but every action button and drawer entry now produces a copyable URL.

### Continuous integration
- **Workflow lint job** — New `.github/workflows/actionlint.yml` runs `actionlint` (pinned via SHA-256 of the official `rhysd/actionlint` 1.7.12 release tarball) against every workflow change, catching action-spec regressions like the Node 20 deprecation we shipped a hotfix for in v0.54.0.
- **Local validation** — Confirmed clean against all existing workflows with `actionlint -shellcheck=` (shellcheck reports are intentionally suppressed for the workflow-spec linter).

### Developer experience
- **`npm run e2e`** — New script in `admin-console/package.json` aliases `playwright test`, plus `npm run e2e:ui` for the interactive runner.
- **iCloud-sync workaround** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` now documents the `TMPDIR=/tmp/sentinel-edge-build` workaround for workspaces under `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`.
- **Changelog reset helper** — New `scripts/changelog_reset_unreleased.py` converts `## [Unreleased]` into a versioned section after a tag, ready for the next cycle.

### Verification
- `cargo test --test api_integration command_lane_endpoint_returns_per_lane_slice -- --exact`
- `cargo test --test api_integration command_summary_returns_lane_health -- --exact`
- `cargo test --test api_integration planned_connector_config_and_validation_persist -- --exact`

- `npm run build --prefix admin-console`
- `actionlint -shellcheck= .github/workflows/*.yml`

## [0.54.0] — Product Command Center, Action Drawers & Connector Onboarding

### Command Center
- **Analyst default workspace** — `/command` is now the analyst primary destination, bringing incidents, active cases, connector gaps, remediation approvals, noisy rules, release readiness, and compliance evidence into one routed operator surface.
- **Inline action drawers** — Command Center metric cards now open focused connector validation, remediation approval, rule replay, release readiness, and evidence-pack drawers so operators can act without losing the command context.
- **Backend summary contract** — New `GET /api/command/summary` aggregates lane health across incidents, cases, remediation reviews, collector readiness, rule quality, release metadata, report templates, compliance posture, and fleet gaps.

### Connector and tuning workflows
- **Planned connector onboarding** — GitHub Audit Log, CrowdStrike Falcon, and Generic Syslog now have setup, validation, public summary, sample-event preview, collector status, OpenAPI, and console API coverage.
- **Rule tuning checklist** — The command surface now shows replay, suppression, and promotion readiness checks for noisy/stale rules before analysts move into the full detection workspace.

### Documentation and validation
- **Command Center runbook** — A new operator runbook covers shift-start triage, connector validation, remediation approvals, rule tuning, release readiness, evidence packs, and escalation handoffs.
- **Routed browser smoke** — Playwright now covers desktop action drawers and the mobile Command Center layout across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Release metadata aligned on v0.54.0** — Rust, admin-console, Python SDK, TypeScript SDK, Helm, OTLP, OpenAPI, install docs, reproducibility notes, and website release surfaces point to the same release baseline.

### Verification
- `cargo test --test api_integration command_summary_returns_lane_health -- --exact`
- `cargo test --test api_integration planned_connector_config_and_validation_persist -- --exact`
- `npm run lint --prefix admin-console`
- `npm test --prefix admin-console -- --run src/__tests__/App.test.jsx`
- `npm run build --prefix admin-console`
- `npx playwright test e2e/command-center.spec.js`

## [0.53.9] — Quality Ratchets, Cross-Browser CI & Live Rollback Hardening

### Quality gates
- **Panic baseline 6 → 0** — Eliminated the remaining production `unwrap`/`expect` calls in `analyst.rs`, `incident.rs`, `benchmark.rs`, `main.rs`, `spool.rs`, and `wasm_engine.rs`. The `scripts/panic-baseline.txt` floor is now `0`, blocking any new non-test panic-bearing API from landing.
- **Coverage gate 56.5 → 60** — `cargo tarpaulin` `--fail-under` raised to 60.0 in CI to lock in the additional coverage gained from defensive-error rewrites.
- **Cargo-mutants nightly matrix** — New `.github/workflows/mutation-testing.yml` runs `cargo mutants` twice weekly across detector / policy / velocity / entropy / correlation modules with `continue-on-error` so escaped mutants surface without blocking releases.
- **Cross-browser nightly matrix** — New `.github/workflows/cross-browser.yml` exercises the full Playwright suite against Firefox and WebKit nightly with artifact upload on failure, complementing the per-PR Chromium runs.

### Live rollback hardening
- **`remediation.allow_live_rollback` gate** — New config flag (default `false`). Live (`dry_run = false`) rollback requests are rejected with `403` and an audit-warn log unless the operator opts in.
- **Typed-host confirmation** — When live rollback is enabled, requests must include `confirm_hostname` matching the change-review's `asset_id` (case-insensitive); mismatches are rejected with `400`. The Infrastructure console adds a "Live Rollback…" danger button that prompts the operator to type the hostname before submitting.
- **`remediation.execute_live_rollback_commands` gate** — Second config flag (default `false`). Accepted live rollback requests continue to record proof and command plans by default; setting this flag enables local matching-platform command execution and returns per-command execution results in the rollback proof payload.

### Verification
- `python3 scripts/check_panic_policy.py` (reports `0`)
- `cargo clippy --lib -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --lib` (1413 passing)
- `cargo test --test api_integration` (212 passing, including new `live_rollback_is_blocked_when_allow_live_rollback_is_disabled`)
- `npm run lint --prefix admin-console`
- `npm test --prefix admin-console -- --run` (210 passing)

## [0.53.8] — Session Hardening, Collector Lifecycle & Release Readiness

### Security and session handling
- **HttpOnly console sessions** — The admin console now exchanges pasted admin tokens for server-side `wardex_session` cookies via `POST /api/auth/session`, sends API requests with credentials, removes legacy `wardex_token` localStorage persistence, and keeps bearer-token auth available for SDKs, automation, and tests.
- **Cookie-aware SDK and console clients** — The TypeScript SDK now supports `credentials`, session inspection/exchange helpers, collector lifecycle status, and remediation change-review APIs so downstream consumers can follow the same session-safe path as the console.

### Collector and remediation workflow depth
- **Persisted collector lifecycle analytics** — Cloud, SaaS, and identity collector status now retains validation lifecycle history, last-success/error checkpoints, retry/backoff state, freshness, failure streaks, and 24h ingestion counts directly in the shared collector contract and Settings lane cards.
- **Remediation change-review ledger** — Infrastructure workflows now expose a persisted change-review and recovery queue for malware verdicts and remediation candidates, including approval status, recovery status, risk, evidence, and focused review creation from the malware verdict workspace.

### Demo, docs, and release confidence
- **Production demo lab** — Help & Docs adds a Demo Lab action backed by `/api/demo/lab`, reusing the first-run proof path to seed telemetry, case context, response dry-run approval, reports, and evidence metadata for realistic evaluation.
- **Release-document drift guard** — Release-doc validation now checks that historical implementation plans are clearly marked as archives and point to current status documents, reducing stale roadmap/product-claim drift.
- **Website and release metadata refresh** — README, status, roadmap, SDK guide, reproducibility notes, OpenAPI metadata, Helm/OTLP values, package versions, and website release surfaces are aligned on the `v0.53.8` baseline.

### Verification
- `cargo check`
- `npm run lint --prefix admin-console`
- `python3 scripts/validate_release_docs.py`
- `npm run test:file --prefix admin-console -- src/__tests__/api.test.js src/__tests__/hooks.test.jsx src/__tests__/App.test.jsx src/__tests__/HelpDocs.test.jsx`
- `cargo test collector`
- `cargo test auth_session`
- `cargo test auth_session_exchange_sets_cookie_and_accepts_cookie_session`
- `cargo test remediation_change_reviews_can_be_recorded_and_listed`

## [0.53.7] — Lint, Coverage & Panic-Policy Tightening

### Quality gates
- **Zero-warnings ESLint gate** — All 11 long-standing `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` and `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` warnings (NDR Dashboard derived arrays, Onboarding wizard checklist, App.jsx redundant location-key reset effect, AlertDrawer / SSO error mirroring) have been resolved or surgically annotated. The admin-console lint script now runs with `--max-warnings=0`, blocking new warnings from landing.
- **Vitest coverage gate** — A v8-backed coverage report runs in CI with global thresholds (statements ≥ 60, branches ≥ 55, functions ≥ 55, lines ≥ 60) so coverage cannot silently regress. Local `npm test -- --coverage` reproduces the gate.
- **Knip dead-code gate** — `knip` is now installed, configured (`admin-console/knip.json`), and wired into CI as `npm run knip` so unused exports, files, and dependencies fail the build instead of accreting between releases. Removed `useDraftAutosave` and demoted `LOCAL_AGENT` test fixture to module-private.

### Panic policy
- **Baseline lowered 19 → 6** — Eliminated 13 production `unwrap`/`expect` calls in `event_forward.rs`, `incident.rs`, `lateral.rs`, `feed_ingestion.rs`, `oidc.rs`, and `benchmark.rs` by switching to `let-else`/`match` patterns and `.ok_or_else(...)?`. The `scripts/panic-baseline.txt` floor moves to 6, ratcheting future regressions tighter.

### Operator experience
- **Empty-state migration continues** — `AssistantWorkspace` (5 sites), `FleetAgents` (1 site), and `ThreatDetection` rule-list / detail (2 sites) now use `WorkspaceEmptyState` for proper `role="status"` semantics and consistent layout, extending the v0.53.6 a11y story.

### Verification
- 208/208 vitest with coverage clean.
- 1409/1409 cargo lib tests pass.
- `cargo check` clean; panic-policy guard at new baseline 6.

## [0.53.6] — Admin-Console Quality Sweep & Panic-Policy Guard

### Operator-experience hardening
- **Shared API error formatting** — Admin-console error rendering is now centralized in `formatApiError`, replacing the ad-hoc message-derivation that was duplicated across Settings, Email Security, and other workspaces. Error toasts and inline failure states now read consistently and surface the backend `X-Request-Id` so support handoffs can be matched to server logs without log archeology.
- **Workspace empty/error primitives** — A reusable `WorkspaceEmptyState` / `WorkspaceErrorState` pair now backs operator workspaces, with `role="status"` / `role="alert"` semantics, optional retry handlers, and a uniform layout. Email Security has migrated its policies empty state onto the shared primitive as the first adopter.
- **Tablist semantics across workspaces** — Settings, Infrastructure, Reports & Exports, Email Security, and NDR Dashboard tab strips now expose proper `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `aria-selected` semantics, restoring keyboard and assistive-technology navigation parity with Live Monitor.

### Code structure
- **Settings module split** — The 5,000-line `Settings.jsx` has been broken up: 35 pure helpers and constants extracted into `components/settings/helpers.js`, and 8 reusable widgets (`ToggleSwitch`, `NumberInput`, `TextInput`, `SelectInput`, `TextAreaInput`, `ValidationIssues`, `CollectorTimelineList`, `CollectorLaneCard`) extracted into `components/settings/components.jsx`. The main file is now ~14% smaller with no behavior change.
- **Dead-code sweep** — A `knip` audit identified three unused admin-console files (`__tests__/test-utils.js`, `components/RuleEditor.jsx`, `types.ts`) and two over-exported helpers; all have been removed without test or build regressions.

### Release confidence
- **Panic-policy CI guard** — A new `panic-policy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `scripts/check_panic_policy.py` on every PR and refuses regressions in non-test `unwrap`/`expect` density (baseline: 19). The policy and verification command are documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Focused regression depth** — 30 new admin-console tests cover Email Security, Investigation Timeline, NDR Dashboard, the shared error formatter, the API client's `X-Request-Id` capture path, the workspace state primitives, and tablist semantics, taking the admin-console suite to 208/208 passing.
- **Release-document accuracy** — README, status, roadmap, reproducibility, installation, OpenAPI, helm, otlp, SDK, and website surfaces are aligned on the `v0.53.6` baseline.

### Verification
- 208/208 admin-console vitest tests passing.
- `cargo check` clean, panic-policy guard at baseline.

## [0.53.5] — Replay Drift, Collector Timelines & Release-Gate Expansion

### Detection validation depth
- **Replay drift breakdowns** — The replay-corpus acceptance gate now exposes platform and signal-type deltas for built-in fixtures, retained-event samples, and custom validation packs so promotion decisions can see where drift is concentrated instead of only reading aggregate precision and recall.
- **Detection workspace runner depth** — Threat Detection now renders those replay deltas directly in the operator workspace and preserves the routed rule/workspace drilldown model introduced in the previous release.

### Integration health visibility
- **Collector ingestion timelines** — Shared collector status now carries lane labels, route targets, and staged timeline checkpoints for cloud, identity, and SaaS collectors so Settings can show credential coverage, scope, validation, and downstream routing in one routed workspace.

### Release confidence
- **Broader live routed smoke coverage** — The release-acceptance browser suite now covers routed response, collector-health, fleet-rollout, and infrastructure remediation workflows in addition to the earlier detection and admin paths.
- **Documentation and release sync** — Status, roadmap, reproducibility, installation, and README surfaces now align on the `v0.53.5` baseline and the release bundle instructions use the real `--version` entry point.

### Verification
- **Focused backend regression coverage** — API and server tests cover replay delta breakdowns, retained-event/custom replay packs, campaign clustering, and enriched collector status metadata.
- **Focused admin-console regression coverage** — Admin-console tests cover replay drift rendering, collector timeline cards, routed rollout/recovery flows, and verdict/remediation workspaces.
- **Release-gate listing validation** — The expanded routed Playwright smoke spec still resolves cleanly through the checked-in Playwright CLI and release-acceptance wrapper.

## [0.53.4] — Detection Quality, Campaign Intelligence & Operator Closure

### Enterprise controls and integration readiness
- **Federated sign-in readiness center** — Settings now includes a dedicated SSO readiness surface with callback URI guidance, ready-vs-review provider state, SCIM mapping visibility, and one-click live SSO launch validation against the real backend login/callback routes.
- **Login-shell SSO closure** — The unauthenticated admin-console shell now explains when federated sign-in is ready, shows SCIM lifecycle state, and makes the callback handoff visible alongside the existing provider sign-in buttons.
- **Collector routing dashboard** — Settings now summarizes cloud and identity collector readiness in operator language, separating identity telemetry and cloud audit lanes and linking them back into SOC, UEBA, infrastructure, and graph workflows.
- **SaaS collector closure** — Settings now adds first-class Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace collector setup, validation, and readiness workflows, plus a dedicated SaaS activity lane alongside the existing cloud and identity routing views.

### Detection workflow closure
- **Route-backed detection drilldowns** — Threat Detection now preserves workspace focus for efficacy, ATT&CK gap, suppression-noise, and content-pack rollout drilldowns directly in the route so analysts can reopen or share exact detection engineering context.
- **Rule detail panel handoffs** — Selected rules now expose URL-backed summary, efficacy, promotion, and hunts/investigations panels, making long detection workspaces feel case-driven instead of forcing analysts to scroll back through the entire page.
- **Entity-centric explainability depth** — Detection explainability now enriches host, agent, action, identity, and network-destination scores with peer-group context, score components, sequence signals, graph pivots, and analyst-readable next pivots in the alert drawer.
- **Campaign correlation bridge** — The Attack Graph now consumes a real `/api/correlation/campaigns` backend that clusters stored events into campaigns, graph edges, sequence summaries, and campaign-ready pivots.
- **Replay corpus acceptance gate** — Detection Engineering now exposes `/api/detection/replay-corpus` and a console gate for benign admin, developer tooling, identity abuse, ransomware, beaconing, and lateral-movement fixtures with precision, recall, and false-positive targets.
- **Custom replay validation packs** — Operators can now `POST /api/detection/replay-corpus` with labeled telemetry samples to run retained-event or customer-supplied validation packs through the same promotion gate.
- **Retained-event replay sampling** — The replay-corpus API can now sample recent stored events through `source: "retained_events"` with limit and threshold controls, giving teams a no-upload path to validate detector drift against live retained telemetry.
- **Replay validation runner** — Threat Detection now includes an operator runner for retained-event replay checks and pasted custom JSON packs, so detector promotion validation no longer requires leaving the console.

### Fleet rollout closure
- **Route-backed rollout workspace** — Fleet & Agents `Updates` now preserves rollout-history, recovery, and deployment-health focus in the route, turning the release tab into a shareable operator workspace instead of a raw config dump.
- **Recovery watchlists and actions** — Operators can now move from rollout issues into offline-agent recovery scopes directly from the updates workspace, with recent rollout and policy activity kept visible beside those actions.

### Remediation workflow closure
- **UEBA response playbooks** — Selected entities now include a route-aware response playbook with peer drift context, suggested ownership, assistant/report pivots, and a concrete next-step narrative for the current anomaly pressure.
- **NDR response playbooks** — Each NDR tab now carries a network response playbook that explains the active signal lane, the primary focus address, and the recommended closure path into SOC, infrastructure, and evidence export.
- **Infrastructure remediation briefs** — Asset explorer, exposure, and integrity views now surface guided remediation and recovery narratives so operators can move from posture review into action without translating raw subsystem data by hand.
- **Malware verdict workspace** — Infrastructure integrity now provides URL-backed malware verdict panels for summary, provenance, recommended actions, and static/behavior profiles, with direct pivots into cases, hunts, reports, and assistant workflows.

### Reporting handoff consistency
- **Dashboard report pivots** — The global dashboard now carries `source=dashboard`, the lead priority-alert target, and a delivery-first tab choice into `/reports`, so the last generic report-center entry point no longer drops operator context.

### Verification
- **Detection workspace regression coverage** — Added focused admin-console coverage for route-aware detection drilldown restoration and rule-panel handoff behavior.
- **Entity scoring regression coverage** — Added backend and admin-console coverage for enriched entity scores, sequence/graph context, and drawer rendering in detection explainability.
- **Campaign graph regression coverage** — Added backend and admin-console coverage for stored-event campaign clustering and Attack Graph campaign intelligence rendering.
- **Replay corpus regression coverage** — Added backend and admin-console coverage for the replay-corpus acceptance gate and Detection workspace rendering.
- **Custom replay-pack regression coverage** — Added API coverage for custom labeled replay-corpus packs.
- **Retained-event replay regression coverage** — Added API coverage for retained-event replay sampling through the replay-corpus promotion gate.
- **Replay runner regression coverage** — Extended Detection workspace coverage to verify the console can launch retained-event replay validation from the Replay Corpus Gate.
- **Fleet rollout regression coverage** — Added focused admin-console coverage for route-aware rollout-history restoration and recovery-to-agents handoff behavior.
- **Dashboard workflow-pivot coverage** — Added focused admin-console coverage for the dashboard-to-report handoff to keep reporting context aligned across overview, SOC, NDR, UEBA, detection, attack-graph, and infrastructure pivots.
- **UEBA/NDR/Infrastructure workflow coverage** — Added focused admin-console regression coverage for the new entity, network, and infrastructure remediation playbooks.
- **SSO and collector workflow coverage** — Added focused admin-console coverage for the new federated sign-in readiness surfaces and the collector routing/health summaries in the integrations workspace.
- **SaaS collector regression coverage** — Added backend and admin-console coverage for Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace collector save/validate flows and for their presence in the shared collector status summary.
- **Malware verdict regression coverage** — Extended infrastructure malware-scan coverage to verify the verdict workspace, action handoffs, and static/behavior profile panels.

## [0.53.3] — Scoped Artifact Persistence & Response-Aware Reporting

### Reporting workflow closure
- **Persisted export artifacts** — Compliance JSON/markdown exports, evidence bundles, audit CSV exports, privacy snapshots, and backend-native alert exports can now be saved into report run history with active `case_id`, `incident_id`, `investigation_id`, and `source` context attached.
- **Original-payload artifact downloads** — Stored run-history artifacts now reopen with their original payload and content type when possible instead of always falling back to generic JSON downloads.
- **Response approval snapshots** — Reports & Exports now captures pending approvals, response requests, and response audit evidence into a dedicated scoped artifact, including target-specific filtering and response-target metadata.

### Investigation handoff consistency
- **Target-aware report pivots** — SOC Workbench, NDR, UEBA, Threat Detection, Attack Graph, and Infrastructure now pass `source` and `target` context into `/reports` so evidence and delivery workflows reopen with the exact operational slice that launched them.
- **Response-aware deep links** — Report links back into SOC, assistant, and investigation views now preserve response target scope so analysts can move between approval review and evidence packaging without losing context.

### Verification and release sync
- **Focused admin-console coverage** — Added regression coverage for persisted compliance markdown artifacts, backend-native alert export artifacts, and target-scoped response approval snapshot persistence.
- **Release-document refresh** — README, status, roadmap, SDK guide, reproducibility notes, and OpenAPI metadata now reflect the scoped artifact persistence and response-aware reporting closure delivered in `v0.53.3`.

## [0.53.2] — Explainable Detection, Incident-First Workflows & Scoped Reporting

### Detection trust and analyst confidence
- **Model-registry controls** — Added model status, shadow-mode inference visibility, rollback support, and a safer heuristic fallback posture so experimental ML paths can be introduced without breaking triage.
- **Analyst feedback capture** — New detection-feedback APIs persist analyst judgments and feed explainability views with concrete investigation context instead of ephemeral UI-only notes.
- **Explainable detections** — Detection detail surfaces now expose API-backed rationale, evidence summaries, and "why this fired" style context to improve analyst trust in alert scoring.

### Onboarding and operator readiness
- **Server-driven readiness checks** — Added onboarding-readiness APIs that validate token state, first-agent presence, telemetry flow, first-alert visibility, threat-intel health, malware scan readiness, and response approval dry-run coverage.
- **Readiness-first onboarding UX** — The admin-console onboarding wizard now consumes those readiness checks directly so operators can distinguish missing data from degraded setup instead of stepping through a static checklist.
- **Manager morning brief** — Dashboard surfaces now include a manager-oriented queue digest for queue health, stale investigations, suppression drift, and operational watch items.

### Incident-first SOC workflow depth
- **Focused case workspace** — SOC Workbench now centers cases as investigation workspaces with narrative context, evidence, case notes, linked incidents/events, ATT&CK context, and direct pivots into assistant, reports, investigations, and response.
- **URL-backed investigation state** — Alert, case, incident, queue-filter, and drawer state is now preserved in route/query parameters across SOC, Assistant, and Reports so analysts can share or reopen exact triage context.
- **Assistant handoff context** — Assistant queries now retain case / incident / investigation scope and can pivot directly back into matching SOC drawers and investigation routes.

### Threat-intel and malware analysis depth
- **Threat-intel `v2` library** — Added normalized indicator metadata, TTL/source weighting/decay visibility, and sightings APIs so threat enrichment includes provenance and recency instead of flat indicator matches.
- **Deep malware scan `v2`** — Added richer malware static and behavior profiles, preserving hash/YARA fast paths while exposing deeper analyst-facing scan context through the API and console.
- **Provenance-first triage UI** — Threat Intel operations now surface indicator metadata and recent sightings directly in the workspace, making enrichment quality easier to inspect during triage.

### Reporting and workflow closure
- **Execution-context-aware reporting** — Report runs, schedules, stored reports, templates, and report previews can now persist `case_id`, `incident_id`, `investigation_id`, and `source` context across backend storage and UI workflows.
- **Scoped artifact library** — Reports & Exports now supports scoped and unscoped artifact filtering, republishing older reports into scoped artifacts, and backend-native filtering for reports, runs, schedules, and templates.
- **Reusable scoped templates** — Analysts can save scoped report templates tied to the active case/incident/investigation workflow and reopen only the relevant preset library later.

### API, SDK, and verification
- **New operator APIs** — Added detection feedback, explainability, model status, onboarding readiness, manager queue digest, threat-intel sightings, deep malware scan `v2`, and scoped report/report-template filtering endpoints.

- **Focused regression coverage** — Added Rust and admin-console coverage for onboarding readiness, explainability feedback, deep malware scan profiles, threat-intel sightings, and execution-context persistence/filtering across reports, runs, schedules, and templates.

## [0.53.1] — Hunt Maturity, SOC UX Throughput, and Case Automation

### Release confidence
- **Release acceptance gate** — Added `scripts/release_acceptance.sh` and `make release-acceptance` to build the shipped admin console and Rust binary, validate published site links, and run the live routed Playwright suite (`live_release_smoke`, `advanced_console_workflows`, `enterprise_console_smoke`, and `mobile_topbar_smoke`) against a real Wardex instance before sign-off.
- **API contract alignment** — Normalized the admin-console to the canonical backend payloads for response audit entries (`audit_log`), fleet dashboard summaries (`fleet.total_agents` and `fleet.status_counts`), and SOC queue items (`queue`), and updated the affected Playwright mocks to match the shipped server contract.

### Threat hunting workflow upgrades
- **Hypothesis-first hunts** — Saved hunts now persist `hypothesis` and `expected_outcome` (`confirm`, `refute`, `explore`) and expose them in the Threat Detection hunt workflow.
- **Retrohunt windows** — Saved-hunt execution now accepts `time_from` and `time_to` windows to scope historical runs to incident timelines.
- **Cron scheduling support** — Hunts now support optional cron expressions in addition to interval scheduling.
- **Escalate-to-case from hunt results** — New `POST /api/hunts/{id}/escalate` creates a case from a selected hunt run and links the resulting case id back to the run.
- **Hunt scorecard telemetry** — Hunt run records now include yield metadata (`yield_rate`, suppression context, linked case id).

### ATT&CK coverage and detection surfaces
- **Coverage gap visibility** — Threat Detection and Attack Graph now surface ATT&CK gap heatmap summaries from coverage gap APIs.
- **Detection domain visibility** — Threat Detection now includes dedicated domain summary cards for malware scanning, feed ingestion, quarantine store, and asset inventory APIs.

- **Saved queue filters** — SOC queue now supports bookmarkable/saved filter presets for recurring analyst query workflows.
- **Bulk case operations** — Case table now supports multi-select with bulk status update actions.
- **Safer destructive actions** — Fleet agent deletes now provide a 5-second undo window before execution.
- **Keyboard table navigation** — Fleet agent table now supports `j`/`k` row navigation, `Enter` to open, and `Esc` to clear detail selection.
- **Fleet column customization** — Fleet table columns are now show/hide toggleable and persisted in local storage.

### Automation depth
- **Dedup incident auto-create path** — New `POST /api/alerts/dedup/auto-create` creates incidents from high-cardinality dedup groups (3+ related alerts in a 5-minute window).

### API additions
- `POST /api/hunts/{id}/escalate`
- `POST /api/alerts/dedup/auto-create`

## [0.53.0] — Rules Marketplace, Tiered Pricing & `wardex doctor`

### Marketing Site
- **Rules marketplace** — New `site/rules.html` renders all 302 built-in detections (92 YARA + 210 Sigma) with filter-by-kind, filter-by-severity, free-text search, and MITRE ATT&CK chip links. Index regenerated at deploy time from `rules/yara/*.json` and `rules/sigma/*.yml` via `scripts/build_rules_index.py`.
- **Tiered pricing** — Rewritten `site/pricing.html` introduces a five-tier plan grid: Community (free, ≤10 endpoints), Starter (€49/mo, up to 25 endpoints), Team (€3/endpoint/mo), Business (€6/endpoint/mo), and Enterprise (custom). Includes monthly/annual toggle, feature comparison table, and 8-item FAQ.
- **Checkout landing** — New `site/checkout.html` Stripe-ready intake form for the Starter tier with order summary and EU VAT support.

### CLI
- **`wardex doctor`** — New preflight subcommand that reports build version, runtime target, config parse status, data/site/rules directory health, and crash-log detection. Exit code 1 on any failed check. Suitable for support-ticket paste-in.

### Admin Console
- **Accessible confirm dialog** — New `<ConfirmDialog>` component with `useConfirm()` hook replaces `window.confirm()` across process kill/isolate and settings actions. Focus trap, ESC handling, tone variants (default/warning/danger).
- **Empty-state component** — New `<EmptyState>` for contextual "no results" screens with primary/secondary CTAs.
- **Copy-to-clipboard** — Reusable button behavior on code snippets and rule names with 1.5s visual feedback.

### Detection Engineering & SOC Operations
- **Identity-routed automation targets** — Auth sessions now expose `user_id`, `role`, `groups`, and `source`, and session-backed operators are checked against hunt and content-pack `target_group` assignments before saving or executing targeted automation.
- **Content pack bundle editor** — Threat Detection can create and edit content bundles directly from rule context, including saved-search templates, recommended workflow routes, target groups, and rollout notes.
- **Persisted program analytics** — Enterprise state now records playbook execution analytics and rollout history so automation and deployment activity survive restarts and feed the SOC workbench overview.
- **Expanded workbench overview** — SOC Workbench now surfaces identity readiness, rollout history, content bundle adoption, automation history, operational analytics, and a recommendation queue with direct pivots into detection, settings, and infrastructure views.

### Fixed
- **Playbook execution API contract** — `/api/playbooks/executions` continues returning live `PlaybookExecution` records even when persisted analytics history exists, avoiding stale or shape-shifted execution responses.
- **Saved hunt reopen flow** — Reopening an existing saved hunt now preserves the original hunt id and update semantics instead of clearing the id and creating duplicates on save.
- **Focused regression coverage** — Added backend coverage for the playbook execution response shape and frontend coverage for saved-hunt reopen/save behavior in the workspace shell suite.

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Rule index in Pages** — Pages deploy workflow regenerates `site/rules-index.json` from the on-disk rule packs so the marketplace always reflects the released rule content.

## [0.52.5] — Release Distribution Dispatch Authorization Fix

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Dispatch-capable release fan-out** — The tagged release workflow now validates `RELEASE_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` and uses it when dispatching GitHub Pages publication and Homebrew tap synchronization, avoiding the `GITHUB_TOKEN` workflow-dispatch permission failure.

## [0.52.4] — Release Asset Publication Fix

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Release asset filtering** — GitHub release publication now downloads only `wardex*` artifacts, excluding the Buildx `.dockerbuild` record artifact that broke release asset extraction.

## [0.52.3] — Release Workflow Completion Fixes

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Lowercase GHCR image naming** — The release workflow now normalizes the GitHub Container Registry image name to lowercase before pushing and signing container images.
- **Post-release dispatch fix** — The release workflow now passes explicit repository context when dispatching GitHub Pages publication and Homebrew tap synchronization, so release-time workflow fan-out works without requiring a checkout.

## [0.52.2] — Release Automation & Container Build Fixes

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Release fan-out automation** — The tagged release workflow now dispatches GitHub Pages publication and Homebrew tap synchronization after the GitHub release is published, so APT and Homebrew distribution stay aligned with the released tag.
- **Tag-aware Pages republish** — Manual Pages runs can now target a specific release tag, allowing deterministic APT repository rebuilds from the exact published release assets.
- **Container build toolchain alignment** — The Docker builder image now uses Rust 1.88 so the container-scan lane matches the dependency floor required by the current crate graph.
- **Container runtime command fix** — The container image now starts Wardex with the current positional `serve` arguments and explicitly serves the bundled site assets from `/app/site`.

## [0.52.1] — Signed APT Delivery & Packaging Fixes

### Packaging & Distribution
- **Signed APT repository publishing** — GitHub Pages now rebuilds a Debian APT repository from the latest published `.deb` asset and signs `Release`, `Release.gpg`, and `InRelease` metadata when the repository signing secrets are configured.
- **APT installation path** — Debian and Ubuntu installs now use a repository keyring plus `apt-get install wardex` instead of a manual `dpkg -i` fallback as the primary path.
- **Linux package service fix** — The packaged systemd unit now points at `/usr/bin/wardex`, passes the correct positional `serve` arguments, sets `WARDEX_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/wardex/wardex.toml`, and can find the packaged static site assets.
- **Linux package provisioning** — Debian packages now create the `wardex` service account, data/log directories, and a default config file during post-install.
- **APT validation CI** — New Ubuntu workflow coverage builds a `.deb`, renders a signed local APT repository, installs from it with `apt-get`, and verifies the installed package layout.

## [0.52.0] — Hunt Workflows, NDR Depth & Release Polish

### Detection & Investigation UX
- **Run-hunt intent wiring** — The detection workspace now consumes `/detection?intent=run-hunt`, opens a dedicated hunt drawer, prefills query/name state from route parameters, and keeps drawer URL state consistent across tune, suppress, and hunt pivots.
- **Inline hunt operations** — Analysts can run a live hunt, save a hunt definition, reopen related saved hunts, and inspect latest hunt results without leaving the selected rule context.
- **Workflow suggestions in context** — Threat Detection now requests builtin workflow suggestions from the selected rule metadata and can start investigations directly from the detection detail pane.
- **SOC planner handoff** — SOCWorkbench can build investigation plans from incident or queue-alert context and pivot the same context into the hunt drawer with prefilled hunt queries.

### Detection Quality
- **False-positive advisor UX** — Rule-specific false-positive patterns now score against selected rule metadata, prefill suppressions, and suggest safer weight reductions.
- **Default intel feed seeding** — The feed engine now ships with common default sources for MalwareBazaar, CISA KEV/STIX, and URLhaus.
- **Email sender heuristics** — Sender-domain scoring now considers suspicious TLDs, punycode, homoglyphs, IP-literal senders, and Message-ID domain mismatches.
- **Persistence-aware LOLBin scoring** — Process scoring now flags scheduled-task, cron, launch agent, service-enablement, and startup-path persistence patterns.
- **Hunt aggregation validation** — Invalid pipe aggregations now fail fast with structured errors instead of silently degrading into empty or misleading results.

### NDR & APIs
- **Beaconing anomaly detection** — NDR now detects low-jitter outbound beaconing cadence and exposes the results in the report model and admin console.
- **Dedicated NDR anomaly endpoints** — TLS, DPI, entropy, self-signed certificate, top-talker, beaconing, and protocol-distribution endpoints are all individually exposed and documented.
- **Search index rebuild contract** — Event-backed search index generation now preserves the alert event class contract while rebuilding from retained events.

### Docs, Packaging & Quality
- **Searchable docs site** — The website resources section now supports client-side search and empty-state handling for operator references.
- **Release-facing docs refresh** — README, status, deployment, SDK, and getting-started material now reflect current package formats, sizing guidance, and release verification expectations.
- **SDK drift CI** — CI now regenerates SDKs and fails if committed artifacts drift from the OpenAPI contract.
- **Focused Playwright smoke coverage** — Deterministic browser smoke tests validate run-hunt routing, investigation planner start, and queue-to-hunt pivots.

## [0.51.0] — ClickHouse, EDR Blocking, WASM Tutorial & Platform Polish

- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Global handler: D/M/T/F/S/G for navigation, ? for shortcut help modal, ⌘K for search.
- **Mobile responsive** — Media queries at 768px (tablet) and 480px (phone): bottom nav, stacked cards, scrollable tables.

### Fixed
- **Borrow checker error** in `detector.rs` `record_fp_feedback()` — split `get_or_insert_with` into separate `is_none()` check + assignment.
- **Duplicate `rbacUsers`** export in api.js — removed redundant declaration that caused Vite build failure.
- **Type mismatch in UEBA test** — `data_bytes` field corrected from `f64` to `u64` literals.

## [0.41.5] — Structured Operator Details & Investigation Resilience

### Fixed
- **Raw JSON leakage in operator flows** — Live Monitor alert detail, alert analysis, Settings, process inspection, and other operator-facing detail panels now render structured nested views instead of dumping raw payload JSON by default.
- **Stale process investigation failures** — Investigating a short-lived process no longer collapses to a generic load error; Wardex now shows the last visible snapshot from the live process table when the PID exits before the full inspection completes.
- **Technical/detail surface consistency** — Raw JSON is now reserved for explicit documentation and export surfaces such as Help & Docs OpenAPI metadata, keeping the embedded console readable for day-to-day operations.

## [0.41.4] — React Console Consolidation, Process Investigation & Release Refresh

### Fixed
- **Process false positives** — The live process analyzer no longer flags `OneDrive Sync Service` as `netcat`, no longer self-detects Wardex when launched from `./...`, and treats relative-path launches as an investigation signal instead of an automatic critical hit.
- **Embedded admin console drift** — The shipped binary now embeds the React admin-console build instead of the retired single-file HTML console, eliminating the split between the latest UI source and the embedded release.
- **Operator UI cleanup** — Dashboard, Live Monitor, Threat Detection, Settings, and Reports now default to structured operator views instead of raw JSON-heavy panels, and alert investigation opens in a side drawer rather than a bottom popout.

### Added
- **Process investigation drawer** — Operators can click a live process to inspect execution context, network activity, code-signing metadata, behavioural findings, and analyst recommendations, then queue kill or isolate actions from the same surface.
- **Admin export surfaces** — Live alert/process exports and dedicated Reports & Exports download actions now provide first-class export paths directly from the embedded console.

## [0.41.3] — Dashboard Layout Polish & Release Copy Sync

### Fixed
- **Alert Severity Distribution layout** — The embedded admin console now keeps the severity chart fully visible inside the dashboard grid, uses a responsive chart shell, and places the legend beneath the doughnut so the card stays aligned across desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.
- **Website release labeling** — The public site now renders the current version directly alongside the BSL 1.1 licensing copy and footer release badge so operators can identify the exact release at a glance.

## [0.41.2] — Release Consistency, Live Monitor Guidance & Verification

### Fixed
- **Live monitor empty state** — The embedded admin console no longer tells operators to start monitoring with `cargo run -- serve`; the initial live-monitor row now renders a neutral loading state until real alert data arrives.
- **Release-document drift** — `README.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`, and the static website now reflect the current release version, current module/API/test counts, and the correct default startup path (`cargo run`).
- **Warning cleanup** — Removed fresh-build warning noise in `server.rs`, `pipeline.rs`, `license.rs`, `backup.rs`, and `storage_clickhouse.rs` so release builds and test runs stay signal-rich.

### Added
- **Live Playwright release smoke** — Added `tests/playwright/live_release_smoke.spec.js` to exercise token login, sample alert injection, live monitor refresh, and release screenshot capture against a running server.

## [0.41.1] — Security Hardening & Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **Authentication enforcement** — 23 new API endpoints (`/api/license`, `/api/search`, `/api/metering/*`, `/api/billing/*`, `/api/marketplace/*`, `/api/prevention/*`, `/api/pipeline/*`, `/api/backup/*`, `/api/collectors/*`, `/api/ml/*`, `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/logout`) now require bearer-token authentication. SSO login/callback remain pre-auth as intended.
- **Search endpoint** — `POST /api/search` now executes queries against the `SearchIndex` instead of returning hardcoded empty results.
- **InMemoryEventStore filters** — `query_events()` and `count_events()` apply all 8 filter fields (device_id, event_class, src_ip, severity_min/max, process_name, time range) instead of ignoring them.
- **Pipeline backpressure** — Increment-before-check with rollback ensures backpressure threshold is correctly enforced; DLQ releases its mutex before acquiring the metrics mutex to prevent potential deadlocks.
- **Marketplace race condition** — `install_pack()` verifies dependency availability before mutating pack state.
- **Cluster snapshots** — `create_snapshot()` handles post-compaction state gracefully; `try_advance_commit()` uses else-break for missing log entries.
- **ML normalization** — `TriageFeatures::to_vec()` clamps `hour_of_day` to [0,23] and `day_of_week` to [0,6].
- **Auth panics** — 4x `.expect()` calls in `auth.rs` replaced with `.unwrap_or_else()` to prevent panics on lock poisoning.
- **Backup symlink safety** — `collect_files()` skips symbolic links to prevent infinite recursion.
- **SSO callback** — Requires `state` parameter for CSRF protection; extracts user identity from `id_token` claims instead of using hardcoded values.
- **License validation** — `POST /api/license/validate` calls `validate_license()` with real Ed25519 verification.
- **Auth session** — `GET /api/auth/session` validates the bearer token and returns actual identity instead of always returning anonymous.
- **Admin console RBAC** — `RoleProvider` defaults to `viewer` (not `admin`) on API failure; validates HTTP response status before parsing.

## [0.41.0] — Enterprise Scale: ClickHouse Storage, ML Triage, HA Snapshots & Cloud Collectors

### Added
- **ClickHouse storage adapter** (`storage_clickhouse.rs`) — `EventStore` trait with `ClickHouseStorage` (buffered batch inserts, MergeTree DDL, materialized views, auto-flush, retention purge) and `InMemoryEventStore` fallback. 12 tests.
- **ML triage engine** (`ml_engine.rs`) — `TriageResult`, `TriageLabel` enum (TruePositive/FalsePositive/NeedsReview), `TriageFeatures` normalization, `triage_alert()` heuristic scoring. API endpoints: `GET /api/ml/models`, `POST /api/ml/triage`. 4 new tests.
- **HA cluster snapshots** (`cluster.rs`) — `Snapshot` struct, `InstallSnapshotRequest/Response`, `create_snapshot()`, `handle_install_snapshot()`, `compact_log()` for log compaction, `raft_log_schema()` DDL for persistent Raft state (raft_log, raft_state, raft_snapshots tables). 6 new tests (24 total).
- **OIDC/SAML SSO endpoints** — 5 API routes wired: `/api/auth/sso/config`, `/api/auth/sso/login`, `/api/auth/sso/callback`, `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/logout`.
- **Cloud collector endpoints** — 4 API routes: `/api/collectors/status` (combined AWS/Azure/GCP), `/api/collectors/aws`, `/api/collectors/azure`, `/api/collectors/gcp`.
- **Structured logging enhancements** (`structured_log.rs`) — `TracingConfig`, `TracingFormat` enum (Json/Pretty/Compact), `generate_request_id()`, `build_logger()` factory function.
- **React Router + RBAC** — Admin console migrated from hash routing to `react-router-dom` with `RequireRole` component, `RoleProvider`, and role-level filtering (viewer/analyst/admin).
- **Demo seed data** — `demo/` directory with Docker Compose, `seed.sh` script, and JSON datasets: 10 alerts, 10 agents, 5 incidents, 3 cases, 15 IoCs.
- **Search module** (`search.rs`) — Full-text `SearchIndex` with tantivy-style API, query parsing, faceted results. 7 tests.
- **Metering module** (`metering.rs`) — `MeteringManager` with usage tracking, plan limits, overage calculation. 9 tests.
- **Billing module** (`billing.rs`) — `BillingManager` with plans, subscriptions, invoice generation. 9 tests.
- **Marketplace module** (`marketplace.rs`) — 10 built-in content packs, install/uninstall lifecycle. 8 tests.
- **Prevention module** (`prevention.rs`) — `PreventionEngine` with default response policies, block/allow/quarantine actions. 9 tests.
- **Pipeline module** (`pipeline.rs`) — `PipelineManager` with ingestion metrics, backpressure tracking, DLQ handling. 7 tests.
- **Backup module** (`backup.rs`) — `BackupManager` with scheduled backups, retention, restore verification. 8 tests.
- **License module** (`license.rs`) — Ed25519-signed license validation, tier enforcement, feature gating. API endpoints wired.

### Improved
- **API surface** — 30+ new endpoint blocks wired into server.rs covering all new modules.
- **Sigma rules** — Expanded from 51 to 202 detection rules across 21 categories.
- **Admin console** — Full SPA routing with browser back/forward, role-based section visibility, history fallback.

## [0.39.5] — Admin Console UX Overhaul, Detection Engine Improvements & Escalation Management

### Added
- **Structured form editor** — Settings page replaces raw JSON with toggle switches, number inputs, and text fields organized by section. Form/JSON toggle for power users.
- **Monitoring scope toggles** — New Settings "Monitoring" tab with toggle switches for each monitoring feature (file integrity, network, auth events, process monitoring) and path listing.
- **Config diff view** — "Show Changes" button in Settings computes line-by-line diff between saved and current config, highlighting additions (green) and removals (red).
- **Reset to defaults** — Settings "Reset Defaults" button restores sensible defaults (collection_interval: 15s, alert_threshold: 2.5, entropy: 10%, etc.).
- **Recharts visualizations** — Dashboard now features severity breakdown pie chart, 24h alert timeline bar chart, and telemetry area chart (CPU + memory trends).
- **Dashboard drill-down** — Clickable alert rows expand to show score, host, source, agent, signal contributions, and full reason breakdown.
- **Alert severity filter** — Both Dashboard and Live Monitor support filtering alerts by severity level (all/critical/severe/elevated/low).
- **FP feedback button** — Each alert in Live Monitor stream has a "FP" button that submits false-positive feedback with auto-extracted pattern from alert reasons.
- **Bulk alert actions** — Multi-select checkboxes in Live Monitor with bulk operations: Mark as FP, Acknowledge/Triage, Create Incident.
- **Cross-signal correlation** — Detector applies bonus multiplier when ≥3 signal axes are simultaneously elevated (3→15%, 4→30%, 5→50%, 6+→70%).
- **Auth failure rate smoothing** — Rolling 8-sample window tracks auth failure acceleration; rate-of-change >4.0 over 3 samples triggers additional detection signal.
- **Suppression rules management** — ThreatDetection hunts tab includes suppression table with inline creation form (name, rule_id, hostname, severity filters).
- **Hunt management UI** — ThreatDetection hunts tab displays hunt table with Name/Severity/Owner/Enabled/Threshold/Last Run columns, inline creation form, and per-hunt Run button.
- **Escalation management console** — New SOC Workbench "Escalation" tab with policy management (create/list with name, severity, channel, targets, timeout), active escalation tracking with acknowledge button.
- **Incident detail view** — Incident drill-down shows structured fields (ID, severity badge, status, created, updated, owner), related events/alerts/agents, storyline timeline, close/export buttons.
- **Escalation API functions** — `escalationPolicies`, `createEscalationPolicy`, `escalationStart`, `escalationActive`, `escalationAck`, `deleteSuppression`.

### Improved
- **Eliminated JSON dumps** — SOCWorkbench overview, cases, response, entity, timeline tabs now render structured key-value grids, tables, and timeline views instead of raw JSON blocks.
- **Infrastructure structured display** — Monitor, correlation, drift, energy, mesh, and system tabs replaced JSON dumps with key-value grids and proper tables.
- **Sigma suppressions preview** — Sigma tab shows suppression summary table with link to full management in hunts tab.
- **Clickable table rows** — Dashboard alerts/processes and Live Monitor alerts support click-to-expand for detailed inspection.

## [0.39.4] — Cross-Platform Process Monitoring, Enhanced Thread Analysis & Bug Fixes

### Added
- **Cross-platform process monitoring** — `/api/processes/live`, `/api/processes/analysis`, and `/api/host/apps` now work on all three platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) instead of returning empty stubs on non-macOS.
- **Linux process analysis** — Detects suspicious names (crypto-miners, reverse shells, /tmp execution), high CPU/memory, root non-system processes, and **deleted executable detection** (fileless malware pattern unique to Linux). Uses `ps` for CPU/memory enrichment and `/etc/passwd` for UID resolution. ~45 known system processes whitelisted.
- **Linux app inventory** — Enumerates installed packages via `dpkg-query` (Debian/Ubuntu) with automatic `rpm` fallback (RHEL/Fedora/SUSE).
- **Windows process analysis** — Detects 25 suspicious patterns including LOLBins (certutil, mshta, regsvr32, rundll32), credential tools (mimikatz, procdump, PsExec), encoded PowerShell, and suspicious execution paths (temp, downloads, AppData). ~33 known system processes whitelisted.
- **Windows app inventory** — Enumerates installed software via `wmic product` with registry fallback (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`).
- **Enhanced thread analysis** — `/api/threads/status` now reports: OS thread count, process RSS memory (MB), process ID, human-readable uptime, actual sample collection rate, platform/architecture, and subsystem health status.

### Improved
- **Process analysis deduplication** — Linux and Windows analyzers no longer discard lower-risk findings for processes with multiple issues; all findings are reported and sorted by risk.
- **Endpoint responses include `platform` field** — All process/apps endpoints include a `platform` key ("macos", "linux", "windows") so the admin console can display platform-specific context.

## [0.39.3] — Live Process Monitoring, App Inventory & Admin Console UX

### Added
- **Live process monitoring** — New `/api/processes/live` endpoint calls macOS `collect_processes()` directly, returning all running processes with CPU/memory usage. Processes tab in Live Monitor with sortable columns (CPU, Memory, Name, PID), text filtering, and security findings display.
- **Process security analysis** — New `/api/processes/analysis` endpoint scans running processes for suspicious names (crypto-miners, reverse shells, tmp execution, encoded commands), high CPU (>80%), high memory (>50%), and non-system root processes. Known macOS system processes (~40) are whitelisted to reduce false positives.
- **Installed apps inventory** — New `/api/host/apps` endpoint enumerates `/Applications` and `~/Applications`, reads Info.plist for version and bundle ID, calculates directory size. Displayed in new Infrastructure → Inventory tab.
- **System inventory tab** — Infrastructure component now has an "Inventory" tab showing hardware info, software packages, services (launchctl), network ports, users, and installed applications in structured tables.
- **SOC Workbench process-tree overhaul** — Process Tree tab now shows live processes sorted by CPU, security findings with risk-level badges, and deep chain analysis in proper tables instead of raw JSON.

### Improved
- **Dashboard restructured** — Dashboard now organized into five logical sections (System Health, Threat Overview, Process Security, Detection Engine, Recent Alerts) with `SectionTitle` components instead of raw JSON dumps.
- **Live Monitor** — Added fourth "Processes" tab with sort controls, filter input, security findings banner, and scrollable process table (top 200 shown with pagination hint).

## [0.39.2] — Share Links, Alert Grouping UI, Isolation Guidance & Detection Tuning

### Added
- **Hash-based deep-linking** — React admin console now supports URL hash routing (`#live-monitor`, `#settings`, etc.) with browser back/forward navigation and a "Share Link" button in the topbar that copies the current view URL to clipboard.
- **Version badge** — Wardex version (`v0.39.2`) displayed prominently in the admin console topbar, sourced from the `/api/health` endpoint.
- **Isolation & response guidance** — Alert analysis now includes per-detection-reason `isolation_guidance` with specific threat descriptions and step-by-step remediation instructions for: network burst, auth failures surge, integrity drift, process count spike, entropy anomalies (low/high), memory pressure, thermal deviation, and disk pressure.
- **Structured analysis display** — Analysis tab in Live Monitor renders a rich UI with summary, metrics cards, severity breakdown, reason table, and isolation guidance cards instead of raw JSON.

### Improved
- **Alert grouping display** — Grouped alerts tab renders a proper table with severity, count, scores, time range, and reasons instead of a raw JSON dump.
- **Entropy anomaly threshold** — Low entropy detection threshold tightened from 15% to 10% of max entropy, and score boost reduced from 0.4 to 0.25, significantly reducing false positives on single-host deployments where metrics like battery, temperature, and integrity are naturally stable.
- **Network burst threshold** — Raised from 1800 kbps (1.8 Mbps) to 3500 kbps (3.5 Mbps) to reduce false positives from normal development and operational traffic while still detecting genuine data exfiltration.

## [0.39.1] — Comprehensive Security Hardening, Bug Fixes & Clippy Cleanup

### Security
- **ZK proof forgery (CRITICAL)** — `proof.rs` Sigma ZK verification accepted any response value. Redesigned to XOR-based nonce masking scheme (`response = H(k) XOR H(c)`) with algebraically verifiable recovery.
- **Deterministic spool encryption (CRITICAL)** — `spool.rs` used a fixed counter with no IV, making ciphertext deterministic. Added random 16-byte nonce prepended to each encrypted spool, with `spool_encrypt`/`spool_decrypt` split.
- **Threat-intel fuzzy matching over-reach** — `threat_intel.rs` applied fuzzy/substring matching to all IoC types including hashes and IPs. Restricted to `BehaviorPattern` and `NetworkSignature` only.

### Fixed
- **Unbounded timing variance** — `side_channel.rs` Welford accumulator grew monotonically and never reflected the sliding window. Recompute mean/variance from windowed samples on each push.
- **WASM compiler ignored operator precedence** — `wasm_engine.rs` compiled expressions left-to-right with no precedence. Implemented shunting-yard algorithm with correct precedence for `* / + - > < >= <= == && || !`.
- **Sigma regex alternation** — `sigma.rs` `Re` modifier failed to expand `(a|b|c)` alternation groups, causing silent rule misses.
- **Sigma kernel event suppression borrow conflict** — `sigma.rs` `evaluate_kernel_event` borrowed engine immutably while needing mutable suppression access. Refactored to collect candidate rules first.
- **CSV escape corrupted negative numbers** — `archival.rs` quoted any field starting with `-`, breaking numeric exports. Added `parse::<f64>()` guard.
- **Campaign empty-set Jaccard returned 1.0** — `campaign.rs` treated two empty technique sets as identical. Now returns 0.0.
- **Benchmark median for even-length arrays** — `benchmark.rs` took wrong index. Fixed to average the two middle elements.
- **FIM stale baselines for deleted files** — `fim.rs` reported deletions but never cleaned up baseline entries, causing repeated alerts.
- **Alert analysis unsorted cluster members** — `alert_analysis.rs` computed first/last_seen from unsorted members. Added timestamp sort before window calculation.
- **WebSocket subscriber ID reuse** — `ws_stream.rs` used `HashMap::len()` as subscriber ID, causing collisions after unsubscribe. Switched to monotonically incrementing counter.
- **Event forwarder O(n^2) drain** — `event_forward.rs` used `remove(0)` in a loop. Replaced with `drain(0..excess)`.
- **Edge-cloud scheduler ignored resource limits** — `edge_cloud.rs` placed EdgeOnly workloads without decrementing remaining CPU/memory.
- **UEBA impossible travel near-zero time** — `ueba.rs` divided by near-zero hours producing infinite speed. Added automatic detection for `hours < 0.001 && dist > 100km`.
- **Lateral movement NaN panic** — `lateral.rs` `partial_cmp` unwrap panicked on NaN scores. Changed to `unwrap_or(Equal)`.
- **Kill chain phase misclassification** — `kill_chain.rs` mapped T1021/T1570/T1534/T1080 (lateral movement) to ActionsOnObjectives instead of Installation.
- **Ransomware low-entropy false positives** — `ransomware.rs` threshold of 1.0 was too permissive. Raised to 2.0.
- **AWS collector truncation split UTF-8** — `collector_aws.rs` byte-sliced strings, potentially splitting multi-byte characters. Uses `char_indices().take_while()` now.
- **Response stale-expiry lost audit trail** — `response.rs` `expire_stale` silently expired requests without recording an audit entry.
- **Response approve endpoint ignored body approver** — `server.rs` always used auth identity as approver, ignoring the `approver` field from the JSON body.
- **Spool constructor panicked on bad key** — `spool.rs` `new()` used `assert!`. Added `try_new()` returning `Result`, `new()` delegates with `.expect()`.
- **React useApi stale closure** — `hooks.jsx` fetch callback captured stale state. Used `fnRef` pattern and fixed `loading` initial state for skipped hooks.
- **React LiveMonitor index-based selection** — `LiveMonitor.jsx` used array index for alert selection, breaking on list reorder. Switched to stable alert IDs.
- **React SOCWorkbench index fallbacks** — `SOCWorkbench.jsx` used array index `0` as fallback for missing IDs.
- **React FleetAgents blob URL leak** — `FleetAgents.jsx` created blob URLs for export without revoking them.

### Changed
- **Zero clippy warnings** — resolved all clippy lints: unnecessary casts, useless `format!`, collapsible `if`, `is_multiple_of()`, and `from_str` trait shadowing.
- **Verification** — automated test count is now 1145 (982 lib + 163 integration).
- **Version sync** — Cargo, Helm, Kubernetes, OpenAPI, SDK, admin console, docs, and site metadata aligned to `0.39.1`.

## [0.39.0] — Detection Engine Improvements, React Admin Console, MITRE Coverage & ML Stub

### Added
- **MITRE ATT&CK coverage tracker** (`src/mitre_coverage.rs`) — 12 tactics, ~65 techniques in matrix, 27 builtin detection-module mappings, heatmap generation, coverage summary with gap analysis, 5 tests.
- **Detection tuning profiles** — `TuningProfile` enum (Aggressive/Balanced/Quiet) with configurable threshold multipliers and learn thresholds, plus normalized 0-100 threat scoring via sigmoid mapping.
- **False-positive feedback loop** (`src/alert_analysis.rs`) — `FpFeedbackStore` tracks analyst FP markings per alert pattern, computes FP ratios and suppression weights (min 0.1, requires ≥5 samples), 4 tests.
- **IoC aging / TTL purge** (`src/threat_intel.rs`) — `purge_expired(now, ttl_days)` removes stale IoCs; `enrichment_stats()` provides by-type/severity/source breakdowns, 3 tests.
- **ML inference engine stub** (`src/ml_engine.rs`) — `InferenceEngine` trait, `StubEngine` placeholder with 3 planned model slots (anomaly detector, entity classifier, alert triage). Prepared for future ONNX runtime integration, 4 tests.
- **12 new Sigma rules** — fileless malware (LOLBins, .NET assembly load), persistence (Run keys, scheduled tasks, systemd, LaunchAgent), defense evasion (indicator removal, masquerading, timestomping), exfiltration (alt protocol, large transfer, archive creation).
- **11 new API endpoints** — `/api/threat-intel/stats`, `/api/threat-intel/purge`, `/api/mitre/coverage`, `/api/mitre/heatmap`, `/api/detection/profile` (GET/PUT), `/api/fp-feedback` (POST), `/api/fp-feedback/stats`, `/api/detection/score/normalize`.
- **React admin console** — full Vite + React 19 migration of admin console with 10 sections (Dashboard, Live Monitor, Threat Detection, Fleet & Agents, Security Policy, SOC Workbench, Infrastructure, Reports & Exports, Settings, Help & Docs), all wired to ~160 live API endpoints with auth, dark/light theme, auto-refresh, toast notifications, MITRE heatmap visualization, and tabbed navigation.

### Fixed
- **Auth token display** — server startup now prints the full 64-character API token instead of only the first 8 characters, fixing the "wrong token" login issue after fresh start.

### Changed
- **Verification** — automated library test count is now 981 (991 total with chaos integration).
- **Version sync** — Cargo, Helm, Kubernetes, OpenAPI, SDK, docs, and site metadata aligned to `0.39.0`.

## [0.38.1] — Approval Separation, Audit Attribution, and Post-Release Hardening

### Security
- **Response self-approval blocked** — `response.rs` now rejects approval decisions where the approver is the original requester, enforcing separation of duties for approval-gated response actions.

### Fixed
- **GraphQL aggregate runtime wiring** — the aggregate query path is now registered in the server execution layer instead of existing only in schema/tests.
- **Hunt automation production wiring** — response actions now execute from scheduled and manual hunt runs, using full matched event/agent scope instead of sample-only context.
- **Threat-intel expiry ordering** — IoC expiry evaluation now compares RFC3339 timestamps chronologically and avoids mixed parsed/string fallback errors.
- **Response notify gating** — `min_level` is enforced when evaluating hunt notification actions.
- **Response target deduplication** — hunt automation no longer collapses multiple agents that share a hostname when generating response targets.
- **Hunt incident reuse** — repeat automation runs now update an existing open hunt incident instead of creating duplicates on every run.
- **Response request IDs** — manual and automated response request IDs now use the hardened unique ID helper instead of timestamp-only generation.
- **Approval audit attribution** — live-response sessions and playbook executions now record the authenticated actor rather than trusting request-body identity fields.

### Changed
- **Version sync** — Cargo, Helm, Kubernetes, OpenAPI, SDK, docs, and site metadata aligned to `0.38.1`.
- **Verification** — automated library test count is now 963 passing tests.

## [0.38.0] — XDR Enrichment, Aggregation Engine, Response Automation & Security Fixes

### Security
- **CRLF header injection (CRITICAL)** — `notifications.rs` `format_email()` now sanitises all user-controlled fields (`\r` stripped, `\n` → space) before interpolation into email headers, preventing SMTP header injection attacks.

### Fixed
- **Jaccard empty-set similarity** — `campaign.rs` `alert_similarity()` returned 0.0 for two empty technique/reason sets; now correctly returns 1.0 (identical empty sets).
- **UEBA risk decay collapse** — `ueba.rs` risk decay was applied per-second instead of per-hour, causing rapid decay to zero after frequent observations. Changed to apply only for `hours_elapsed >= 1.0` using `hours_elapsed.floor()` in the exponent.
- **Incident auto-cluster early break** — `incident.rs` `auto_cluster_incidents()` broke after merging into the first matching open incident, silently skipping other qualifying incidents. Removed `break` in both MITRE-technique and severe-burst clustering loops.

### Added
- **UEBA peer-group normalization (XDR Phase B)** — new `PeerGroupBaseline` struct, `peer_group_baseline()` for aggregate group stats, and `peer_deviation_check()` that flags entities deviating >3× risk or >5× data volume vs. peers (excluding self from baseline).
- **GraphQL aggregation engine (XDR Phase C)** — `AggregateOp` enum (Count/Sum/Avg/Min/Max/Distinct) with `FromStr`, `aggregate()` supporting optional GROUP BY over JSON arrays, full `AggregateResult`/`AggregateGroup` types, and schema integration.
- **Hunt response automation (XDR Phase D)** — `HuntResponseAction` enum (Notify/CreateIncident/AutoSuppress/IsolateAgent), `SavedHunt` extended with `response_actions`, `tags`, `mitre_techniques` fields, and `evaluate_responses()` method with template variable substitution.
- **STIX/TAXII data enrichment (XDR Phase E)** — `threat_intel.rs` gains `ingest_stix_bundle()` for STIX 2.1 indicator parsing, `batch_check()` for bulk IoC lookups, `expiring_iocs()` for feed rotation, and `parse_stix_pattern()` supporting 8 IoC types.
- **17 new tests** (931 → 948): CRLF injection, empty-set similarity, risk decay preservation, peer deviation detection, multi-incident clustering, 7 GraphQL aggregation tests, 2 response automation tests, 3 STIX/threat-intel tests.

### Changed
- **Clippy** — `AggregateOp::from_str()` refactored to `impl std::str::FromStr` to satisfy `clippy::should_implement_trait`.

## [0.37.0] — Production Hardening: Code Safety, Structured Logging, Release Optimisation

### Fixed
- **25 unwrap/panic sites eliminated** — `cluster.rs` (15 mutex locks), `feature_flags.rs` (8 mutex locks), `entity_extract.rs` (1 `parts.last().unwrap()`), `storage.rs` (1 `Option::clone().unwrap()`). All mutex locks now use `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` for poison recovery.
- **Double-unwrap on storage initialisation** fixed in `server.rs` (2 sites, shipped in v0.36.3 hotfix).
- **Raft log gap vulnerability** — `cluster.rs` `handle_append()` now rejects non-contiguous entries instead of silently creating log gaps that could cause state divergence across cluster nodes.
- **Spool nack data-loss bug** — `spool.rs` `nack()` was popping a new entry from the front of the queue instead of retrying the failed one. Changed signature to accept the failed entry, ensuring correct retry semantics.
- **RBAC authorization bypass** — `check_rbac()` in `server.rs` returned `true` when no RBAC users were configured, allowing any authenticated token to bypass authorization. Now correctly denies non-admin access when RBAC is unconfigured.
- **Version sync** — fixed 10+ stale version references across site, SDK, OpenAPI, Helm values, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation.

### Changed
- **Structured logging** — all ~45 `eprintln!` calls in production code converted to `log::info!`/`log::warn!`/`log::error!` via the `log` crate. `env_logger` initialised at startup; set `RUST_LOG=info` (or `debug`/`trace`) to control verbosity.
- **Release profile optimised** — `[profile.release]` added with `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`. Binary size reduced to ~8.6 MB.
- **Clippy-clean codebase** — `[lints.clippy] all = "warn"` enforced. 220 warnings resolved (auto-fixes + manual). `unsafe_code = "forbid"` at crate level.
- **Version sync** — Cargo.toml, Helm Chart.yaml, README, STATUS, and ROADMAP all aligned to `0.37.0`.

### Added
- **11 new tests** — cluster concurrent-operations safety, commit-index advancement, election check, Raft gap rejection, feature-flags kill-switch override, concurrent stress, unknown-flag safety, entity-extract edge cases (empty input, domain validation, no-IP verification), spool multi-entry nack correctness. Total: 931 lib tests.
- `env_logger = "0.11"` and `log = "0.4"` dependencies.

## [0.36.3] — TLS/mTLS Listener, Chaos Tests Expansion, Hardening 98%

### Added
- **TLS/HTTPS listener** — opt-in `tls` Cargo feature enables `Server::https()` via rustls. Set `WARDEX_TLS_CERT` and `WARDEX_TLS_KEY` env vars to activate. Falls back to plain HTTP when not configured or feature not compiled.
- **mTLS support** — `ListenerMode::Tls` carries full `TlsConfig` including client CA path and `require_client_cert` for mutual TLS agent authentication.
- **5 new chaos/fault-injection tests** — oversized headers, wrong HTTP methods, empty/invalid auth headers, rapid endpoint sweep, oversized JSON bodies. Total chaos tests: 10.

### Changed
- **Production hardening** score updated from 95% (56/59) to 98% (58/59). Only 1 control remains: package manager distribution (10.5).
- **Startup banner** now shows `https://` scheme when TLS is active.
- Warns at startup if `WARDEX_TLS_CERT`/`KEY` env vars are set but binary was compiled without `tls` feature.

### Tests
- **920 lib + 10 chaos integration tests passing**, 0 failures, 0 warnings.

## [0.36.2] — Complete Retention Purge, Production Hardening 95%

### Added
- **Metrics purge** — `purge_old_metrics(retention_days)` in storage.rs; wired into background scheduler.
- **Response actions purge** — `purge_old_response_actions(retention_days)` in storage.rs; wired into background scheduler.

### Changed
- **Background retention scheduler** now purges all 4 record types (alerts, audit_log, metrics, response_actions) instead of just 2.
- **Production hardening** score updated from 80% (47/59) to 95% (56/59). Only 3 controls remain: mTLS for agents, package manager distribution, chaos testing.

### Tests
- **920 lib tests passing**, 0 failures, 0 warnings.

## [0.36.1] — Bug Fixes: Spool Safety, WASM, Ransomware API, Migration Rollback

### Fixed
- **Spool counter overflow** — replaced `.expect()` panic with `wrapping_add()` in spool cipher counter (src/spool.rs).
- **WASM div-by-zero** — replaced overly strict `f64::EPSILON` comparison with `== 0.0` check (src/wasm_engine.rs).
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unused `crc32_simple()` function and its test from archival.rs. Zero compiler warnings.

### Added

### Tests
- **920 lib tests passing** (+4 net: 5 new tenant isolation/audit tests, 1 dead CRC32 test removed), 0 failures, 0 warnings.

## [0.36.0] — Completeness: GraphQL, Real SMTP/Gzip, Poison Recovery, Syslog

### Added
- **GraphQL API** — wired `/api/graphql` POST endpoint with 5 resolvers (alerts, agents, status, events, hunts) backed by live `AppState`, plus schema introspection.
- **Syslog forwarding** — audit events forwarded via UDP RFC 5424 to configurable target (`WARDEX_SYSLOG_TARGET` env var) with severity mapping.
- **DB schema version API** — `GET /api/admin/db/version` endpoint returning migration history and current schema version.
- **Schema introspection** — `StorageBackend::schema_version()` and `schema_info()` methods exposing migration state.

- **Real SMTP delivery** — replaced email stub in `notifications.rs` with full SMTP conversation (EHLO → MAIL FROM → RCPT TO → DATA → QUIT) over TCP with retry and exponential back-off.
- **Mutex poison recovery** — all 232 `.lock().unwrap()` sites now use `.unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` to survive poisoned mutexes without panicking.
- **OpenAPI spec** bumped to 0.36.0 with GraphQL and DB version endpoint definitions.

- **Documentation alignment** — refreshed README, feature summary, getting-started guide, status doc, and roadmap so release posture, capabilities, and operator guidance are consistent with the shipping product.
- **Release metadata** — version bumped to `0.31.0`, product description updated, and release packaging prepared for Linux, macOS, and Windows tagged builds.

### Fixed
- **Live admin smoke stability** — the enterprise browser smoke now seeds a sample alert before asserting live-monitor content and correctly re-opens the sidebar when validating mobile navigation.
- **Integration-test warning cleanup** — removed a non-fatal scheduled-hunt polling warning in the enterprise API regression suite.

### Tests
- `cargo test` passes with **692 automated tests**.
- Live browser smoke passes for the enterprise admin console.

## [0.30.0] — XDR/SIEM depth, UI polish & hardening

### Added — Phase A: Quick Polish
- **Loading skeletons** — shimmer animations for alerts and XDR event tables during data fetch.
- **Rich empty states** — icon + title + subtitle + action button shown when alerts, events, or incidents tables are empty.
- **Confirm modal** — all destructive `confirm()` calls replaced with a styled async modal dialog (`showConfirm()`).
- **Copy-to-clipboard** — one-click copy buttons for enrollment tokens and admin session tokens.
- **Theme toggle** — light/dark theme switch with full CSS variable overrides and persistent `localStorage` preference.
- **Severity-colored metric cards** — threat level cards dynamically styled by severity class.
- **Error handling** — all silent `catch` blocks replaced with `log()` calls for visibility.

### Added — Phase B: UI Restructure
- **Fleet tab split** — Fleet & Agents section split into 3 tabs: Fleet Overview, Agent Registry, Events & Triage.
- **Incident Response tab split** — IR section split into 3 tabs: Incidents, Investigation, Response.
- **Chart.js theme awareness** — charts adapt grid/tick/label colors to light or dark theme; resize on section switch.
- **ARIA accessibility** — `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"` on all tab systems; `aria-label` on 7 data tables.

### Added — Phase C: XDR Wiring
- **Correlation score escalation** — cross-agent correlated alerts receive a +0.15 score boost (capped at 1.0) with level re-evaluation.
- **Response execution** — `execute_approved()` method transitions Approved→Executed with descriptive action logs; new `POST /api/response/execute` endpoint.
- **Agent policy enforcement** — background policy poll thread applies server-pushed `alert_threshold` and `interval_secs` to the agent monitoring loop via `Arc<Mutex<>>`.

### Added — Phase D: SIEM Depth
- **SIEM config API** — `GET/POST /api/siem/config` endpoints for runtime SIEM configuration; `config()` and `update_config()` methods on `SiemConnector`.
- **SIEM retry with backoff** — `send_to_siem()` retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s).
- **STIX/TAXII 2.1 client** — `TaxiiClient` pulls STIX indicator objects from TAXII collection endpoints, parses patterns and confidence into `SiemIntelRecord`; new `GET /api/taxii/status`, `GET/POST /api/taxii/config`, `POST /api/taxii/pull` endpoints.
- **SIEM/TAXII configuration UI** — Settings card with SIEM push config (type, endpoint, token, index) and TAXII 2.1 threat intel config (URL, auth, poll interval, manual pull button).

### Added — Phase E: Hardening
- **Enrollment token TTL** — `expires_at` field on `EnrollmentToken` with `new_with_ttl()` constructor; `is_valid()` checks both uses and expiry; `POST /api/agents/token` accepts optional `ttl_secs`.
- **Forensic bundle encryption** — `write_encrypted()` / `read_encrypted()` using AES-256-GCM (12-byte nonce ∥ ciphertext); `aes-gcm` dependency added.
- **CSS transitions** — smooth transitions on buttons, cards, and interactive elements; touch target sizing (44px minimum on coarse pointer devices).

### Tests
- 667 tests (542 unit + 125 integration), all passing.
- New tests: STIX pattern parsing, STIX bundle parsing, TAXII disabled client, SIEM config getter/setter, token TTL valid/expired/round-trip, forensic encryption round-trip + wrong-key rejection.

## [0.29.1] — Code review hardening & admin panel improvements

### Fixed
- **CORS origin validation** — `cors_origin()` now rejects wildcard `"*"` origins and validates that the `SENTINEL_CORS_ORIGIN` value uses an `http://` or `https://` scheme, defaulting to `"http://localhost"` for invalid or missing values.
- **CSV formula injection** — `csv_escape()` now prefixes cell values starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `|`, or tab with a single-quote character to prevent spreadsheet formula injection in exported CSV files.

### Added
- **Session Management panel** (admin console Settings) — displays session info (uptime, token age, TTL, expiry countdown, status, mTLS requirement) and provides one-click token rotation with automatic UI credential refresh.
- **Audit & Retention panel** (admin console Settings) — shows audit chain integrity status (record count, checkpoint count, head hash) with verify button, and retention policy controls (max records per category, current counts) with apply/refresh actions.
- **Auto-load on navigation** — opening the Settings section now automatically refreshes session info and retention status alongside existing settings data.

### Improved
- **Comprehensive code review** — 38-point review covering security, error handling, logic, code quality, API design, test coverage, performance, and deployment. Verified constant-time token comparison and checkpoint interval guards were already in place from v0.29.0.

## [0.29.0] — Production hardening: session management, retention, container & service deployment

### Added
- **Token TTL & session expiry** — configurable `security.token_ttl_secs` (default: 1 hour) with automatic rejection of expired tokens in `check_auth()`. `GET /api/auth/check` now returns TTL metadata (`ttl_secs`, `remaining_secs`, `token_age_secs`).
- **Token rotation** — `POST /api/auth/rotate` generates a new admin token and resets the TTL clock, immediately invalidating the previous token.
- **Session info** — `GET /api/session/info` returns uptime, token age, TTL, expiry status, and mTLS requirement.
- **Configurable retention policies** — new `[retention]` config section with `audit_max_records`, `alert_max_records`, `event_max_records`, `audit_max_age_secs`, and `remote_syslog_endpoint`. `GET /api/retention/status` shows policy and current counts. `POST /api/retention/apply` trims alerts and events to configured limits.
- **Audit chain verification endpoint** — `GET /api/audit/verify` reports audit log integrity status, record count, and chain verification result. Added `verify_and_report()` and `apply_retention()` to the cryptographic `AuditLog`.
- **Spool per-tenant partitioning** — `SpoolEntry` now carries an optional `tenant_id`. Added `enqueue_with_tenant()`, `entries_for_tenant()`, and `tenant_counts()` for multi-tenant event isolation.
- **mTLS configuration** — new `[security]` config section with `require_mtls_agents` and `agent_ca_cert_path` fields, wiring into the existing TLS module's `with_mtls()` support.
- **Remote log forwarding** — `retention.remote_syslog_endpoint` config field for remote syslog destination, complementing the existing SIEM connector push capabilities.
- **Dockerfile** — multi-stage container build with non-root user, health check, read-only filesystem, and volume for persistent state. Includes `docker-compose.yml` reference.
- **Systemd service unit** — `deploy/wardex.service` with full security hardening (NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem, MemoryDenyWriteExecute, etc.), journal logging, and restart policy.
- **Launchd plist** — `deploy/com.wardex.agent.plist` for macOS service deployment with KeepAlive and throttle interval.
- **Chaos/fault injection tests** — 5 new integration tests: rapid token rotation stress (10 cycles), concurrent burst load (50 requests), malformed JSON resilience, expired token rejection across endpoints, and path traversal rejection.
- **6 new API integration tests** — token rotation, session info, auth check TTL metadata, audit verify, retention status, retention apply.
- **8 new unit tests** — security/retention config round-trips, audit verify/report, audit retention trimming, spool tenant-aware enqueue/filter/persist.

### Improved
- **EventStore** — added `count()` and `apply_retention(max)` methods for policy-driven event trimming.
- **656 tests** (531 unit + 125 integration), all passing.

## [0.28.0] — Research tracks UI, monitoring UX, and code review hardening

### Added
- **Research Tracks panel** — new admin console section displaying all 40 research tracks (R01–R40) grouped into 8 thematic categories, with expandable detail cards showing approach, rationale, and current state. Includes filter-by-status controls (Foundation/Scaffolded/Planned/Future) and live track count.
- **Research Tracks nav item** — dedicated navigation entry between Reports & Exports and Settings.

### Improved
- **Monitoring scope UX (Settings)** — the "Monitoring Scope" header now clearly indicates it applies to the **Main Server & Default for Agents**, with guidance text explaining that per-agent overrides are available in Fleet & Agents.
- **Per-agent monitoring scope layout (Fleet)** — replaced inline flex-wrap with a proper responsive grid layout (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(170px, 1fr))`) for cleaner alignment of the 13 monitoring toggles. Improved description text to reference Settings → Monitoring Scope.

### Fixed
- **Critical: IIFE scope bug** — 11 inline `onclick` handlers referenced functions defined inside the IIFE closure, causing `ReferenceError` at runtime for Sigma Rules refresh, Case Management (refresh/new/submit/cancel), Alert Queue refresh, RBAC (add/refresh), and Feature Flags refresh. Replaced all inline `onclick` attributes with `addEventListener` wiring inside the IIFE.
- **XSS vulnerability** — dynamically generated `onclick` attributes for Alert Queue "Ack" and RBAC "Remove" buttons used single-quoted string literals that could be broken by crafted IDs/usernames. Replaced with `data-*` attribute event delegation pattern.
- **Missing CSS variables** — `--danger`, `--green`, and `--teal` were used but never defined in `:root`. Added definitions: `--danger: #ef4444`, `--green: #22c55e`, `--teal: #14b8a6`.
- **Missing CSS class** — `.dot-teal` was used in Case Management and Process Tree section headers but never defined. Added definition.

## [0.27.1] — Bug-fix: network burst false positives & RBAC admin bypass

### Fixed
- **Critical: macOS network byte overcounting** — `netstat -ib` lists each interface multiple times (once per address: Link, IPv4, IPv6, etc.) with identical cumulative byte counters. The collector summed all rows, inflating the metric by up to 9× on en0. Now only `<Link#N>` rows are counted, yielding accurate kbps values and eliminating cascading false "network burst" alerts.
- **RBAC admin token lockout** — after adding the first RBAC user, the admin token holder was denied sensitive operations (DELETE users, config, shutdown) because the RBAC enforcement checked `"admin-bootstrap"` which didn't exist in the user store. Admin token holders now bypass RBAC entirely.
- **Minimum column check** — macOS `collect_network()` now requires ≥ 10 columns (was 7), matching the actual `netstat -ib` layout.

### Added
- `tests/live_test.py` — comprehensive 77-endpoint live server test harness.
- `tests/verify_admin.py` — admin console data-shape verification script.

## [0.27.0] — Phase 27: Operational contract & production hardening

### Added
- **OpenAPI 3.0 specification** (`docs/openapi.yaml`) covering all 149 API endpoints with schemas, tags, and security annotations.
- **`GET /api/openapi.json`** — public endpoint serving the OpenAPI spec.
- **`GET /api/slo/status`** — service-level objective metrics (latency, error rate, availability, budget).
- **`POST /api/rbac/users`** and **`DELETE /api/rbac/users/{username}`** — RBAC user create/remove endpoints.
- **Schema lifecycle documentation** (`docs/SCHEMA_LIFECYCLE.md`) — versioning strategy, compatibility rules, migration process, fixture validation.
- **Disaster recovery plan** (`docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`) — backup/restore procedures, RTO/RPO, key escrow, DR validation tests.
- **SLO policy** (`docs/SLO_POLICY.md`) — availability, latency, and error budget definitions with alerting rules.
- **Deployment models guide** (`docs/DEPLOYMENT_MODELS.md`) — standalone, multi-tenant, edge relay, regional federation.
- **Threat model** (`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`) — promoted from handoff pack with adversary profiles, abuse cases, trust boundaries.
- **Production hardening checklist** (`docs/PRODUCTION_HARDENING.md`) — 59-control scorecard (47 implemented, 80%).
- **XDR professional roadmap** (`docs/ROADMAP_XDR_PROFESSIONAL.md`) — Tier 1–4 feature plan through Phase 36.
- Request counter (`request_count`, `error_count`) in server state for SLO computation.

### Fixed
- **Critical: `apiFetch()` undefined in admin console** — 16 call sites used an undefined function, making all newer admin sections non-functional. Defined proper `apiFetch()` helper.
- **Data-shape bugs in admin console** — `refreshSigma()`, `refreshRbac()`, `refreshCases()` now correctly unwrap server response objects (`.rules`, `.users`, `.cases`).
- **Sigma stats field name** — `stats.total_matches` → `stats.total_rules`.
- Separated server rate limiting into read/write/static buckets so authenticated admin polling no longer self-triggers `429 Too Many Requests` under normal use.
- Hardened the default CORS origin to `http://localhost` when `SENTINEL_CORS_ORIGIN` is unset.

### Changed
- Admin console `createCase()` upgraded from browser `prompt()` to professional inline form with priority, description, and tags.
- Admin console ARIA accessibility: skip-to-main link, `role` attributes, `aria-current` navigation, keyboard handlers, focus-visible styles.
- Copyright updated to 2025–2026.
- `generate_admin.py` deprecated — edit `site/admin.html` directly.
- Version bumped to 0.27.0; 160/160 backlog tasks complete; all 27 phases done.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.26.0] — Phase 26: Security audit fixes

### Fixed
- **RBAC enforcement on sensitive writes**: `check_rbac()` previously returned `true` on all paths, effectively bypassing role-based access control. Now uses `RbacStore::check_api_access()` to deny sensitive write operations when RBAC users are configured and the request lacks sufficient privileges.
- **RateLimiter memory leak**: The per-IP rate-limit bucket map never evicted stale entries, allowing unbounded memory growth from ephemeral client IPs. Added periodic cleanup that retains only entries active within the last 120 seconds.
- **Audit log status code accuracy**: `AuditLog::record()` was always called with a hardcoded `200` status. Now extracts the actual HTTP response status via `response.status_code().0` before recording.
- **Spool cipher counter overflow protection**: Upgraded the CTR-mode counter from `u64` to `u128` and switched from wrapping to `checked_add()` to prevent silent counter reuse (theoretical at `u64`, impossible at `u128`).

### Changed
- Version bumped to 0.26.0.

## [0.25.0] — Phase 25: Code review hardening, platform collectors, analyst console

### Added
- **Phase 23 — OCSF, Sigma, Response, Feature Flags, Process Tree, Spool, RBAC** (T188–T194):
  - `ocsf.rs`: OCSF event normalization with dead-letter queue for parse-rejected events, schema registry endpoint (`/api/ocsf/schema`, `/api/ocsf/schema/version`).
  - `sigma.rs`: 25 Sigma detection rules (SE-001 through SE-025) covering credential attacks, lateral movement, data exfiltration, cryptomining, privilege escalation, DNS tunneling, reverse shells, and more. `/api/sigma/rules` and `/api/sigma/stats` endpoints.
  - `response.rs`: Automated response engine with approval workflow, configurable playbooks, pending/audit/stats endpoints.
  - `feature_flags.rs`: Feature flag system with user/group/percentage targeting and A/B experiment support. `/api/feature-flags` endpoint.
  - `process_tree.rs`: Process tree analysis with deep-chain detection (depth ≥5), orphan tracking, and injection heuristics. `/api/process-tree` and `/api/process-tree/deep-chains` endpoints.
  - `spool.rs`: Encrypted local event spool with retry/dead-letter semantics. `/api/spool/stats` endpoint.
  - `rbac.rs`: Role-based access control with Admin/Operator/Analyst/Viewer roles and user management. `/api/rbac/users` endpoint.
- **Phase 24 — Platform collectors, analyst console, SIEM formats, DLQ wiring** (T195–T203):
  - `collector_windows.rs`: Windows collector with WMI queries, registry enumeration, and Windows Event Log parsing (13 tests).
  - `collector_linux.rs`: Linux collector with /proc filesystem, journalctl log parsing, and systemd service enumeration (19 tests).
  - `collector_macos.rs`: macOS collector with sysctl, IOKit power metrics, and unified log parsing (15 tests).
  - `siem.rs`: Added Elastic ECS (`format_elastic_ecs()`) and QRadar LEEF (`format_qradar()`) SIEM output formats alongside existing Splunk HEC.
  - `analyst.rs`: Full analyst console — case management (CRUD, status workflow, priority, assignee, timeline, tags), alert queue with acknowledgement and assignment, full-text event search with faceted filtering, investigation timeline builder, investigation graph with entity relationships, remediation approval workflow with audit trail. 20+ API endpoints.
  - Dead-letter queue wired into server API: `GET /api/dlq` (list), `GET /api/dlq/stats`, `DELETE /api/dlq` (drain).
  - 5 operational runbooks in `docs/runbooks/` (incident response, deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, disaster recovery).
- **Phase 25 — Code review hardening** (T204–T207):
  - Replaced insecure XOR spool cipher with SHA-256 CTR mode (`spool_cipher`) for semantic security without additional dependencies.
  - Wired `AuditLog::record()` into HTTP request handler — every API call now records method, URL, source IP, status code, and auth flag.
  - Activated `check_rbac()` enforcement on sensitive write endpoints (`/api/config/`, `/api/shutdown`, `/api/updates/`, `/api/enforcement/`, `/api/rbac/`).
  - Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions from `AuditLog`, `AuditLog::record()`, and `check_rbac()` in `server.rs`. Three platform-specific suppressions remain in `collector.rs` and `service.rs` (Linux-only fields).

### Changed
- Total modules: 58 (was 44).
- Total tests: 635 (521 unit + 114 integration), up from 437.
- Runtime manifest: 120/120 tasks, 25 phases.
- Version bumped to 0.25.0.

### Added
- **Per-agent monitoring scope**: Each enrolled agent can now have a custom monitoring scope override (CPU, memory, network, disk, processes, auth events, thermal, battery, file integrity, services, LaunchAgents, systemd units, scheduled tasks). `GET/POST /api/agents/{id}/scope` manages overrides; heartbeat responses now include the effective scope so agents can dynamically adjust collection.
- **Cross-platform scope gating**: All 13 monitoring signals in the collector are now individually gated by their respective scope toggle. Previously only 3 of 13 signals respected scope settings.
- **Bulk event triage**: `POST /api/events/bulk-triage` accepts an array of event IDs and applies status, assignee, tags, and notes to all in one call (max 500 events). The event table now has checkboxes for multi-select with a "Bulk Triage" button.
- **Deployment rollback**: `POST /api/updates/rollback` creates a new downgrade deployment targeting a previous release version with `allow_downgrade: true`. Rollback and Cancel buttons appear in the Agent Drilldown when a deployment is active.
- **Deployment cancellation**: `POST /api/updates/cancel` moves a pending deployment to `cancelled` status immediately.
- **Automatic staged rollout progression**: When `auto_progress` is enabled in rollout settings, completed canary deployments auto-progress to ring-1 after the configured soak period, and ring-1 auto-progresses to ring-2. Failed deployments trigger automatic rollback when `auto_rollback` is enabled.
- **Rollout configuration API**: `GET /api/rollout/config` returns current rollout settings; settings are patchable via the config reload endpoint with `{ "rollout": { ... } }`.
- **Admin UI rollout panel**: Auto-rollout settings (progression toggle, soak times, auto-rollback, max failures) are now configurable directly from the Fleet section.
- **Agent monitoring scope panel**: The Fleet section now includes a per-agent monitoring scope configuration panel with 13 toggles and server-default reset functionality.
- **Durable XDR event history**: Fleet events are now persisted to JSON on disk so analyst workflow and fleet history survive server restarts.
- **Event triage workflow**: `POST /api/events/{id}/triage` lets operators assign analysts, attach tags, add notes, and move events through `new`, `acknowledged`, `investigating`, `contained`, and `resolved` states.
- **Rollout controls for remote updates**: Remote deployments now support rollout groups (`direct`, `canary`, `ring-1`, `ring-2`) and explicit downgrade opt-in for controlled rollback scenarios.

### Changed
- **Fleet dashboard payload**: Dashboard analytics now include triage counts, event-history persistence status, and rollout-group summaries for deployments.
- **Admin console Fleet view**: Event Explorer now supports triage-state filtering, inline triage updates, bulk operations, and remote deployments expose rollout-group, rollback, and cancellation controls.
- **Heartbeat protocol**: Heartbeat responses now include `monitor_scope` with the effective monitoring scope for the agent (custom override or server default) and auto-rollout progression checks.
- **Public architecture section**: The GitHub Pages landing page now renders the pipeline stages as a responsive architecture board instead of a cramped horizontal strip.

## [0.23.0] — Fleet drilldowns and remote deployments

### Added
- **Remote agent update assignment**: Operators can now assign a published release to a specific enrolled agent. Assigned versions are surfaced in heartbeat responses and prioritized during agent update checks.
- **Agent drilldown API and UI**: Fleet now exposes per-agent detail views with recent event timelines, risk transitions, aggregate risk metrics, and pending deployment visibility.
- **Filtered event exploration and CSV export**: `GET /api/events` now supports agent, severity, reason, and correlation filters, and `GET /api/events/export` exports the filtered result set as CSV for incident triage.
- **Monitoring path health checks**: Settings now report whether active file-integrity and persistence baseline paths exist and are readable on the current host.

### Changed
- **Fleet dashboard payload**: The Fleet summary now includes recent release catalog data and pending deployment counts so the admin console can drive remote rollout actions directly.
- **Agent update client flow**: Agent downloads now resolve relative update URLs correctly and can react immediately to server-assigned deployment targets instead of waiting only for periodic polling.

## [0.22.0] — XDR analytics and monitoring visibility

### Added
- **Fleet event analytics**: XDR now computes top attack reasons, severity mix, hot-agent risk summaries, and fleet-wide correlation rate from agent event traffic.
- **Policy history visibility**: Admin console can now inspect published policy history instead of only the current active version.
- **Monitoring path visibility**: Settings now show the active file-integrity and persistence baseline paths derived from the current monitoring scope.

### Changed
- **Authenticated event reads**: `GET /api/events` and the new `GET /api/events/summary` now require admin auth while agent-side event ingestion remains tokenless for enrolled agents.
- **Fleet posture freshness**: Agent staleness is refreshed before agent-list and fleet-dashboard reads so XDR analytics use current status rather than stale cached values.

## [0.21.1] — Phase 24 follow-up

### Added
- **Scoped persistence baselines**: Service-persistence monitoring now baselines OS-specific startup locations for `systemd` units, macOS LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons, and Windows Scheduled Tasks when enabled in Settings.
- **Per-platform operator guidance in Settings**: The Monitoring Scope panel now explains which monitoring points are recommended or unavailable on the current host and shows how many persistence baseline paths are active.

### Changed
- **Auth-event scope toggle is live**: Authentication-event collection is now a real configurable collector toggle instead of a read-only placeholder.
- **Local monitor baselines persist across samples**: File-integrity and persistence monitors now retain their baselines between server refresh cycles instead of being rebuilt on every sample.

## [0.21.0] — Phase 24

### Added
- **OS-aware monitoring scope settings**: Settings now expose a Monitoring Scope section driven by host platform and capability data. Operators can see what is monitored, what is recommended on the current OS, and which signals are planned but not yet available.
- **`GET /api/monitoring/options`**: New authenticated endpoint returns grouped monitoring options, support status, recommendations, and host metadata for the admin console.

### Fixed
- **Frontend auth regressions**: Settings loading, checkpoint counts, detection summary, and thread status requests now consistently send Bearer auth headers after Phase 23 hardening.
- **Alert detail stale reopen**: Manually closed alert detail rows no longer re-open on the next refresh because stale cached detail state is cleared correctly.
- **Live report summary counts**: `/api/report` now reports `critical_count` accurately instead of folding severe alerts into the critical total.
- **Config validation and hot reload semantics**: Negative severity thresholds are rejected, monitor intervals must be positive, numeric fields must be finite, and flat legacy patch fields now override nested objects predictably.
- **File-integrity scope control**: Local file-integrity monitoring now respects the configured monitoring scope instead of running whenever watch paths exist.

### Security
- **Additional sensitive GET endpoints now require auth**: `/api/checkpoints`, `/api/correlation`, `/api/monitoring/options`, and `/api/host/info` metadata are aligned with the authenticated admin-console contract.

## [0.20.0] — Phase 23

### Added
- **Alert sort by criticality**: Dropdown to sort alerts by Critical → Elevated or Elevated → Critical, in addition to default time order.
- **Alert detail survives refresh**: Open detail rows are preserved across auto-refresh cycles instead of being destroyed by table re-render.

### Fixed
- **False alarm suppression**: Raised `elevated_score` from 1.4 → 2.8 and `learn_threshold` from 1.35 → 2.5 so normal system noise (~2.0 score) no longer triggers constant "Elevated" alerts. Baseline now adapts to normal fluctuations instead of freezing.
- **Consecutive-sample confirmation**: Monitor thread requires 2 consecutive elevated-score samples before firing an alert. Critical/Severe bypass confirmation for immediate response.
- **Reports show live data**: `/api/report` now generates report from live monitoring alerts instead of falling back to demo sample data. Empty state returns an empty report rather than synthetic data.

### Security
- **Auth required on sensitive endpoints**: `GET /api/alerts`, `/api/alerts/count`, `/api/report`, `/api/status`, `/api/endpoints`, `/api/threads/status`, `/api/detection/summary`, and `/api/telemetry/*` now require Bearer token authentication. Only `/api/health` remains public.
- **Frontend sends auth headers**: All fetch calls (`refreshAlerts`, `refreshReport`, `refreshStatus`, `refreshTelemetry`, `refreshHostInfo`, `loadApiEndpoints`, `refreshHealth`) now include auth headers.

### Removed
- **Research Blueprint Coverage section** removed from the Help panel along with `renderTracks()` function and related state.

## [0.19.0] — Phase 22

### Added
- **Graceful shutdown via CLI and web console**: Real `ctrlc::set_handler()` for SIGINT/SIGTERM handling. `POST /api/shutdown` endpoint with auth and `server.unblock()` for clean exit. Shutdown button in Settings "Danger Zone" with double-confirmation dialog.
- **Expandable alert detail rows**: Click any alert row to reveal full telemetry snapshot (all 10 metrics) and detection analysis (score, confidence, all reasons, severity classification, recommendation). `GET /api/alerts/{index}` endpoint returns analysis JSON. Accordion-style collapsing (one open at a time).
- **Help section redesign**: Three categorised sections (Getting Started / Detection & Architecture / Reference) with improved spacing, line-height, and typography. All CLI commands and API references updated.
- **Alert detail API**: `GET /api/alerts/{index}` returns full telemetry, all detection reasons, severity class, multi-axis flag, and contextual recommendation.

### Security
- **JSON injection fixes**: Replaced `format!(r#"..."#)` string interpolation with `serde_json::json!()` in agent deregistration, fleet registration, threat-intel IOC, and mode-set endpoints.
- **Bounded body reads for chunked encoding**: New `read_body_limited()` helper using `std::io::Read::take()` enforces 10 MB limit even for chunked transfer encoding. All 17 request body reads migrated.
- **Sensitive GET endpoints require auth**: `/api/telemetry/current`, `/api/telemetry/history`, `/api/host/info`, `/api/config/current` now behind token authentication.
- **Auth on `/api/mesh/heal`**: POST endpoint added to auth-required list.
- **Consistent security headers**: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` on static files (was SAMEORIGIN), `Cache-Control: no-store` added to static responses.

### Changed
- `serve_loop` rewritten from blocking iterator to `recv_timeout(500ms)` + shutdown check loop for clean exit.
- `handle_api` accepts `server: &Server` parameter for shutdown coordination.
- `AppState` gains `shutdown: Arc<AtomicBool>` field.
- Runtime manifest updated to 109/109 tasks, 22 phases.
- Version bumped to 0.19.0.

## [0.18.0] — Phase 21

### Added
- **Velocity rate-of-change detector**: Tracks per-axis first derivative (velocity) and second derivative (acceleration) over a sliding window. Flags ramp-ups where the latest velocity exceeds mean + σ·std, even when absolute values remain below static thresholds. Configurable window size and sigma threshold.
- **Shannon entropy detector**: Computes per-axis entropy over a sliding window using histogram binning. Low entropy (<15% of max) flags constant attack traffic (cryptominers, DDoS floods). High entropy on auth-failures axis (>90%) flags randomised credential stuffing and evasion.
- **Compound multi-axis threat detector**: Counts simultaneously elevated axes and applies a score multiplier (`score × (1 + fraction × 0.5)`) when ≥40% of axes spike together. Detects coordinated attacks that spread across CPU, network, auth, disk, and temperature.
- **Detection analysis panel** in admin console: Threat Detection section now shows velocity, entropy, and compound detector configuration with live status from `/api/detection/summary`.
- **`GET /api/detection/summary`** endpoint returning velocity/entropy/compound detector state.
- **Help & Docs updates**: Three new detection method sections in the "How Detection Works" accordion.

### Security
- **Path traversal hardening**: `canonicalize()` validation on static file serving prevents symlink-based directory escape.
- **Request body size limit**: 10 MB cap on API request bodies with 413 rejection.
- **Security headers**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Cache-Control: no-store` on JSON responses; `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and CORS headers on static file responses.
- **MIME type coverage**: Added `ico` and `woff2` content types.

### Changed
- Monitor thread now enriches EWMA signals with velocity, entropy, and compound analysis before alert threshold evaluation.
- Runtime manifest updated to 102/102 tasks, 21 phases.
- Version bumped to 0.18.0.

## [0.17.1] — Phase 20
